IMPHAL: BJP general secretary in Manipur N Nimbus Singh said on Sunday that the recent split between NPF and BJP in Nagaland will not affect the coalition government in Manipur. In the 60-member assembly, the coalition government in Manipur has two-third majority with 40 legislators, comprising 30 MLAs from BJP, four each from NPF and NPP, one from LJP and one Independent MLA.

Among the four NPF MLAs, Losii Dikho holds the public health and engineering department, printing and stationary portfolios. The remaining three - Awangbow Newmai, Khasim Vashum and K Leishiyo -were appointed as parliamentary secretaries by the N Biren Singh government, before the posts were discontinued last year. They are considered to be loyal to the NPF faction led by Nagaland chief minister TR Zeliang.

"The political twist in Nagaland which saw NPF part ways with the BJP will not be a threat to the current coalition structure in Manipur," Nimbus told TOI. "Neither the BJP nor the NPF in Manipur has any issue with the development in Nagaland. We strongly believe that the current government in Manipur will run smoothly without any differences and hard feelings among the coalition partners," he added.
Nimbus further said that the Manipur unit of BJP workers have been supporting and assisting BJP candidates in Tripura while the party's vice-president Sh Premananda Sharma is assisting the campaign in Meghalaya. "We had deputed two to three workers for each BJP candidate in Tripura," he said. BJP legislators and ministers from Manipur will also join the campaign in Meghalaya and Nagaland, Nimbus added.
