<p><b>Singapore &amp; Bangalore, India </b><b>–</b><b> Nov 13, 2017</b><b> –</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Active.Ai, a Singapore-headquartered FinTech platform with an innovation lab in Bengaluru that delivers conversational banking through artificial intelligence (AI), announced a US $8.25 million Series A financing led by Vertex Ventures, Creditease Holdings, and Dream Incubator. Existing investors Kalaari and IDG Ventures India will also participate in the round. Ben Mathias, Managing Partner at Vertex Ventures, and Vani Kola, Managing Director at Kalaari Capital, will join Sanat Rao from IDG Ventures India on the company’s board of directors. Anju Patwardhan from Creditease will join as a board observer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Active-Ai’s proprietary AI engine, Triniti, enables financial institutions to have a meaningful engagement with their customers in an intuitive natural format over multiple apertures covering messaging, voice, and IOT devices. This full-stack solution has been built ground-up and comprises machine learning, natural language processing, and natural language generation. Keeping in mind the requirements of financial institutions, the company offers the flexibility of deployment: on-premise or in the cloud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in early 2016, the company is working with some of the top-tier banks and insurance companies in India, Malaysia, Singapore, and North America.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ravi Shankar, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Active Intelligence, said, “I am excited by the future possibilities of AI and how this technology will shape the banking and financial world.
