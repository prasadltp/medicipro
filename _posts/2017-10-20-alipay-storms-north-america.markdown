Chinese payments giants are paving the highway into the US payments industry, and someone (namely, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and Android Pay) ought to get nervous. Alipay has resources and domestic experience to potentially dominate any market.

Operated by Ant Financial Services Group, Alipay is the world's largest mobile and online payment platform.

Alipay has evolved from a digital wallet to a lifestyle enabler: users can hail a taxi, book a hotel, buy movie tickets, pay utility bills, make appointments with doctors, or purchase wealth management products directly from within the app.

In addition to online payments, Alipay is expanding to in-store offline payments both inside and outside of China. Over 10 million brick-and-mortar merchants now accept Alipay across China. Alipay's in-store payment service covers more than 30 countries across the world, and tax reimbursement via Alipay is supported in 24 countries and regions. Alipay works with over 250 overseas financial institutions and payment solution providers to enable cross-border payments for Chinese traveling overseas and overseas customers who purchase products from Chinese e-commerce sites. Alipay currently supports 27 currencies.

"Alipay, one of the world's leading digital payment platforms, has partnered with Poynt, the maker of the world's first smart terminal, to enable Alipay's more than 520 million registered users in China and beyond to pay with Alipay across all Poynt devices in North America.

Now, US merchants of all sizes can benefit by offering Alipay as a payment type in their stores.

The number of Chinese consumers visiting North America is predicted to grow to four million this year. In addition, the Chinese middle class is presently the single fastest-growing online consumer market in the world, estimated to grow to 600 million by 2020, and North American merchants will be well-positioned with this customer base if they are able to accept the preferred payment type of this consumer demographic whether in-store or online.

"Through our strong partnership with NAB, over 120,000 of NAB's PayAnywhere merchants are now enabled with Alipay which includes best-in-class support," said Souheil Badran, President of Alipay North America.

Alipay is enabled on the EPX processing platform and will be accessible to independent software vendors (ISVs) wanting to integrate with the technology in December 2017. PayAnywhere users are able to use a camera, or barcode scanner, to accept Alipay through both the mobile app and PayAnywhere Storefront. By the end of 2017, Alipay acceptance will be rolled out to all of NAB's semi-integrated MICROS terminals, along with their entire Ingenico terminal merchant base.
