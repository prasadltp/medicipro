## OCBC launches Face ID authentication for banking apps on iPhone X

* OCBC Bank has rolled out banking authentication using the iPhone X's new feature, Face ID.

* The Face ID system uses a mathematical model of users' faces to allow them to sign onto their phones or pay for goods with a steady glance at their phones.

* OCBC OneLook is the first service in Singapore to use the facial recognition technology to enable payments or the viewing of bank account, credit card, and investment information, the bank said on Monday (Nov. 6).

* OCBC Bank customers using the iPhone X can authenticate access to its consumer and business banking apps like OCBC Mobile Banking, OCBC OneWealth, and OCBC Business Mobile Banking by looking at their phones, instead of using passwords or fingerprints.

* The bank does not store any account numbers, balances or other related information on the phone and two-factor authentication is required should the customer wish to perform banking transactions.
