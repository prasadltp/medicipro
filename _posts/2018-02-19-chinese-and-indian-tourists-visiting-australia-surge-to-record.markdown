NEW DELHI: Chinese and Indian tourist arrivals in Australia jumped to a record last year as growing middle-class wealth in the worldâ€™s most populous nations fuels the travel bug.

Almost 1.4 million visitors from mainland China traveled to Australia last year, a 13 percent increase from a year earlier, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Tourists from India climbed to 302,900 over the period, a 15 percent advance from a year earlier.

"While much of the focus has been on Chinese tourism, Indian visitors are coming Down Under in their droves," said Ryan Felsman, a senior economist at the securities unit of Commonwealth Bank of Australia. "Most are coming to visit family members studying in Sydney and Melbourne. Cricket pilgrimages to the Melbourne Cricket Ground and Bradman Museum in Bowral are also a priority."
