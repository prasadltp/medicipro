[Shane Williams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shane-smartwealth/), Co-founder of UBS SmartWealth, shares the experience of launching a robo-advisory service inside a large bank, covering choices between build or buy, in or outside the organization (setting a separate entity or not?), with the pros and cons of either choice.

Williams also covers important elements of the process of setting up a business inside a business: the building blocks of UBS SmartWealth, the technological transformation that the bank goes through, and what his team was able to build having a clean sheet.
