While financial use cases of blockchain technology are at the spotlight due to the significant interest of powerful parties – banks, investors, and even [governments](https://letstalkpayments.com/government-blockchain-relationships-2017/)– non-financial use cases of DLT are of equally significant importance to a number of industries. Along with banks and FinTech startups, non-financial players have been paying attention and looking for ways to leverage the opportunities that DLT opens. Let’s look at some [interesting examples of the applications of blockchain technology beyond financial services](https://letstalkpayments.com/21-areas-of-blockchain-application-beyond-financial-services/):
