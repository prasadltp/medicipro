<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financial services industry is no stranger to machine learning – a number of large institutions continue to successfully implement the technology across such </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2016/06/04/machine-learning-is-redefining-the-enterprise-in-2016/#2a65c5b01871"><span style="font-weight: 400;">areas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as risk analytics and regulation, customer segmentation, cross-selling and upselling, sales and marketing campaign management, creditworthiness evaluation. Among institutions that are applying machine learning are BBVA, JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, OCBC, and many more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Credit applications and underwriting are the </span><a href="https://igniteoutsourcing.com/publications/machine-learning-in-finance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">key areas where machine learning, and data analytics in general, will have an initial impact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The outcomes will include cost reductions, increased efficiency, and less onerous customer experiences," experts </span><a href="http://www.barclaysimpson.us/news/machine-learning-the-next-frontier-for-financial-risk-management--news-801817925"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suggest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

The banks have achieved these gains by devising new recommendation engines for clients in retailing and in small and medium-sized companies. They have also built micro-targeted models that more accurately forecast who will cancel service or default on their loans, and how best to intervene, the consultancy says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let's explore some interesting examples of machine learning applications in banking.</span></p>

<td style="width: 165px;"><b>BBVA</b></td>
<td style="width: 581px;">Cristóbal Sepúlveda, Technical Architect at BBVA, exposed an actual use case of this technology: “At BBVA, we developed a service recommendation engine for bank users. With this proposal, what we are trying to do is offer the best commercial offer depending on the most used transactions by the user and their navigation patterns.<br />
All this information is processed in a classification algorithm which then generates a recommendation. “The volume of information is incredibly vast and the only way to offer a recommendation is using machine learning technologies,” he noted.

<td style="width: 165px;"><b>JPMorgan Chase</b></td>
<td style="width: 581px;">At JPMorgan Chase, a learning machine is parsing financial deals that once kept legal teams busy for thousands of hours. The program, called COIN (Contract Intelligence), does the job of interpreting commercial-loan agreements that, until the project went<br />
online in June 2016, consumed 360,000 hours of work each year by lawyers and loan officers. The software reviews documents in seconds, is less error-prone and never asks for vacation. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Made possible by investments in machine learning and a new private cloud network, COIN is just the start for JPMorgan Chase. The firm set up technology hubs for teams specializing in big data, robotics and cloud infrastructure to find new sources of revenue while reducing expenses and risks. The system already is helping the bank automate some coding activities and making its 20,000 developers more productive, saving money.<br />
When needed, the firm can also tap into outside cloud services from Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-28/jpmorgan-marshals-an-army-of-developers-to-automate-high-finance">Read more here. </a> </span></td>

<td style="width: 165px;"><b>HSBC</b></td>
<td style="width: 581px;">The CIO at HSBC Darryl West said the bank is using machine learning to run "analytics over this huge dataset with great compute capability to identify patterns in the data to bring out what looks like nefarious activity within our customer base. The patterns that<br />
we identify are then escalated to the agencies and we work with them to track down the bad guys." The bank said earlier this year that it is using Google Cloud machine learning capabilities for AML. <a href="https://www.computerworlduk.com/galleries/data/how-uk-banks-are-looking-embrace-ai-machine-learning-3657529/">Read more here. </a></td>

<td style="width: 165px;"><b>OCBC</b></td>
<td style="width: 581px;">The Singapore-based OCBC Bank has unveiled plans to use artificial intelligence and machine learning as part of its efforts to reduce financial crimes. The bank intends to deploy these technologies to deal with the increasing scale and complexity of AML<br />
monitoring, in addition to increasing the bank’s operational efficiency and accuracy in the detection of suspicious transactions.<br />
OCBC Bank has conducted a PoC with ThetaRay. Now, the company plans to start an extended PoC and a pre-implementation phase. The algorithm will detect anomalies in transactional behavior by evaluating broad parameters such as products, customers, and risks, instead of looking at each transaction as a standalone. In the PoC stage, the technology was deployed to analyze one year’s worth of OCBC Bank’s corporate banking transaction data. The findings demonstrated that it decreased the number of alerts, which did not require further review, by 35%. <a href="http://riskmanagement.banking-business-review.com/news/ocbc-bank-to-use-ai-and-machine-learning-to-combat-financial-crimes-091117-5967954">Read more here. </a></td>

<td style="width: 165px;"><b>Lloyds Banking Group</b></td>
<td style="width: 581px;">Lloyds Banking Group has partnered with AI startup Pindrop to use its machine learning technology to detect fraudulent phone calls. Pindrop can identify 147 different features of a voice from a phone call or even a Skype call, which can help a person identify<br />
information such as the location that a caller is in creating an "audio fingerprint". Lloyds Banking Group will introduce the software across the Lloyds Bank, Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands. Lloyds said the partnership with Pindrop will help it cut down call times as well as protect customers. "The reason for us doing it is about saving money from fraud," said Martin Dodd, Group Telephone Managing Director at Lloyds Banking Group. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/11/lloyds-uses-google-backed-ai-to-detect-phone-fraudsters.html">Read more here. </a></td>

the rise and use of credit default swaps [CDS] contracts leading up to the financial crisis. We did this by using text analytic methods to machine-measure the frequency with which these contracts were mentioned in filings by corporate issuers. We then examined the<br />
trends across time and across corporate issuers to learn whether any signal of impending risk emerged that could have been used as an early warning." Until today, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bauguess-big-data-ai">SEC<br />

Such anomalies are investigated, with the result being fed back into the system so it can learn and thus further build the customer profile.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"While previous financial fraud detection systems depended heavily on complex and robust sets of rules, modern fraud detection goes beyond following a checklist of risk factors – it actively learns and calibrates to new potential (or real) security threats. This is the place of machine learning in finance for fraud – but the same principles hold true for other data security problems. Using machine learning, systems can detect unique activities or behaviors (“anomalies”) and flag them for security teams. The challenge for these systems is to avoid false-positives – situations where “risks” are flagged that were never risks in the first place," <em>Tech Emergence </em></span><a href="https://www.techemergence.com/machine-learning-in-finance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emphasizes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
