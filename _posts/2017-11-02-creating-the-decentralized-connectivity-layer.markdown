[Daniela Perdomo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielaperdomo/), Co-founder & CEO of [goTenna](https://gotenna.com/) (a company that builds next-generation wireless architecture that enables low-power, low-cost, easily reconfigurable, resilient communication from the bottom-up), questions the concept of connectivity, envisioning communities where our smartphones can become self-sufficient connectivity nodes to enable wireless transfer of information.

Perdomo explains the concept of goTenna Mesh: inspired by the idea of a decentralized wireless architecture, it pairs with one's phone and hops text and GPS communications from device to device, so that individual users can create their own network anywhere, with no service required.
