Apple Pay has admittedly went through its fair share of bumpy roads and will encounter more as it rolls out around the world. [Underestimation of the solution](https://letstalkpayments.com/is-apple-pay-leading-from-behind-again/), and mobile contactless payments, in particular, [have not been ungrounded](https://letstalkpayments.com/is-the-dusk-of-mobile-apps-inevitable/). Nonetheless, numbers don't lie, Apple Pay has revealed impressive data indicating the potential of the solution, which is proven to be a favored payments method when made available.

## Apple Pay now in 20 markets, nabs 90% of all mobile contactless transactions where active

Merchants and others who have partnered with Apple say that Apple Pay is accounting for 90% of all mobile contactless transactions globally in markets where it's available.

"Apple Pay is the future of everyday spend," [said](https://twitter.com/alarabasul/status/922262055951900673) Jennifer Bailey, Apple's VP of Apple Pay, on stage at the Money20/20 conference that kicked off in Las Vegas yesterday.

Bailey also announced that the service is launching in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the UAE in the next few days, bringing the total number of countries where it is used up to 20. And she said that 4,000 issuers worldwide now work with the wallet (that is, there are now 4,000 credit and debit card issuers whose cards can now be uploaded to and used via Apple Pay).

While these may not sound like massive numbers on their own, 20 markets represents a full 70% of the world's card transaction volume, she noted. This underscores how Apple is approaching the rollout of its payment service: it is moving first to where the money is.
