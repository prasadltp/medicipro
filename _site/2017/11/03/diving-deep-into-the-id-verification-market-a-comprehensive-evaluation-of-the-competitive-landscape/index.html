<p>The world is getting smarter and the consumers are becoming increasingly impatient, especially in today’s digital age. With technology innovations happening every day, customers are looking for services which require less time and minimal effort on their part. In this technologically advanced era where users can perform and manage their daily tasks with just a few clicks, visiting branch offices for opening a bank account seems unnecessary.</p>

<p>With the ever-tightening regulations and increasing concerns over AML/CFT, banks are now more cautious than ever in their KYC processes. Traditionally, this process involved physical ID/Document verification in which the applicant had to personally visit a branch office and present the relevant documents so that a bank representative can verify the applicant’s authenticity. This practice was not only expensive and time-consuming but also hampered customer experience as they as had to wait for days before getting approved for a new account.</p>

<p>But the KYC process has finally moved to the next stage where customers no longer have to attend face-to-face meetings or visit a branch for authenticating their documents. Financial institutions can make use of various web-based and mobile-based applications to verify an applicant’s identity.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-digital-iddocument-verification-process-is-carried-out">How the digital ID/document verification process is carried out</h2>

<p>Electronic identity verification (eIDV) enables banks and financial institutions to remotely verify a person’s identity through digital means. Unlike the age-old method of physical verification, which required the physical presence of both the applicant and documents like passport, license, utility bills, etc., eIDV checks various consumer data points such as name, date of birth, address, etc. The data is checked against a pool of databases such as government agencies, credit bureaus, telephone/utility records, public data, watch lists, cyber-data, etc., in order to verify an applicant’s legitimacy.</p>

<p>With the increasing demand of eIDV, the market has witnessed various technological breakthroughs applied in this space such as biometric-based verification, machine learning, blockchain, video-based and behavior-based verification.</p>
