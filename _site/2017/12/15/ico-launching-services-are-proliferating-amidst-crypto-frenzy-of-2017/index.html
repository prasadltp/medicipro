<p>With demand comes supply, and the old truth proved to be working in 2017 when we saw a significant proliferation of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/what-does-a-wise-decision-on-ico-look-like/">Regulatory bodies have come through for an innovative way to fund an enterprise</a>, extending the opportunity to invest to larger audiences.</p>

<p>The total amount raised by startups via ICOs reached nearly $800 million in value in Q2 2017. Combined with the first quarter, that total ICO funds raised during the first half of the year came in at $1.13 billion, TechCrunch reports. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ico-tracker/">CoinDesk’s ICO tracker</a> shows that from January 2017 to the end of November 2017, the volume of funding collected through ICOs reached close to $3.48 billion.</p>

<p>To meet the demand for the latest funding model, a range of companies started offering ICO launching services.</p>

<p><a href="https://icobox.io/">ICO Box</a> offers a tiered suite of services for companies launching their ICOs.
