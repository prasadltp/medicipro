<p>If the history of FinTech teaches us something, it’s that unexpected things happen. Seemingly successful cases meet speed bumps, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/lending-club-saga-from-a-different-point-of-view-for-the-larger-good/">pivoting the history of the whole segment</a>. Today’s picks are dedicated to that – to the ups and downs of remarkable businesses and technologies.</p>

<h2 id="square-has-just-begun-its-ascent-with-loans-and-high-tech">Square Has Just Begun Its Ascent With Loans and High Tech</h2>

<p>Square, being one of the most remarkable success stories in FinTech, is on the fast track to becoming an influential institution of the new age. After all, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/08/dear-silicon-valley-americas-fallen-out-of-love-with-you/">Silicon Valley is the Wall Street of 2017</a>. Square will likely be a rare case of a startup that managed to <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/secret-of-success-in-fintech-partner-merge-acquire/">build its way into niche markets</a>, starting with <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/overview-of-the-payments-industry/">payments</a>, and now – lending.</p>

<h3 id="star-of-the-show--loan-automation">Star of the Show – Loan Automation</h3>

<p>While Square started as a payments service, its expansion into loans is a big attraction for investors. JPMorgan sees Square Capital as the most profitable value-added service in the Square empire. The client onboarding services are fully automated, and Jack Dorsey reported that 99.95% of loan applications get decided automatically by the system.</p>

<p>The average loan size is small at $6,000 but the portfolio loss size is respectable at 4%. The World Bank sets the acceptable microloan loss rate at 5% globally. For small businesses that rely on its payments and POS services, Square has a strong database to access the credibility of its retail business borrower which it enhances its predictive ability with machine learning and data analytics. Such technology can even extend to consumer loans in the near future.</p>

<h2 id="sofi-withdraws-us-banking-application-citing-leadership-change">SoFi Withdraws US Banking Application, Citing Leadership Change</h2>

<p>US digital lending FinTechs seem to always get into trouble – because of internal troubles, players are hurting themselves as well as the market one after the other. After Lending Club and Prosper, it’s SoFi now.</p>

<h3 id="the-company-is-facing-sexual-harassment-lawsuits">The company is facing sexual harassment lawsuits.</h3>

<p>Student online lender Social Finance said on Friday that it is withdrawing its application for a bank license in the wake of the departure of a number of senior executives, including Co-founder &amp; former CEO Mike Cagney.</p>

<p>“A bank charter remains an attractive option when the time is right. This decision does not change our plans to make deposit accounts available through partner banks in the near future.”</p>

<p>Earlier this month, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters said that Cagney’s departure in September had complicated SoFi’s banking application because regulators assess whether a company has a capable CEO before allowing it to accept deposits.</p>

<p>SoFi is one of the most valuable private financial technology startups in the United States and was valued at over $4 billion in its last funding round.</p>
