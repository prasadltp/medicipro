<p>International tourists spent close to <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.TVLX.CD">$1.4 trillion</a> during their cross-border adventures in 2015. Since international tourism is one of the largest sources of income for a significant number of destinations around the world – in developing countries and developed ones – the banking industry has had to evolve their instruments to ensure that costs associated with international payments are democratized enough, and, at the same time, leverage the opportunity to profitably prime the traveling population to incur significant expenses.</p>

<p>Regardless of how far the FinServ industry has come in stacking up perks on credit cards, one of the biggest consumer pain points in international payments remains intact – foreign transaction fees.</p>

<p>But what if I told you that there is one network operating across 185 countries that allows cardholders to make foreign payments with no foreign transaction fees? It’s time to rediscover Discover Financial Services – one of the most unique global FinServ businesses.</p>

<p>Discover started its journey in 1985 and <a href="https://www.discover.com/company/our-company/">introduced its first cash reward credit card</a> in 1986. Discover was the first in the industry to introduce a cash rewards card and also offer 24/7 customer service without charging an annual fee, all of which was almost unheard of back in 1986. Today, Discover Global Network features more than 70 million cardholders, 37 million merchant acceptance locations and one million ATM and cash access locations across 185 countries and territories.</p>

<p>The company’s <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/936756523/files/doc_financials/quarterly_results/2017/Q2/DFS-Earnings-Release-2Q17-FINAL.pdf">Q2 2017 financial report</a> reveals that Discover credit card loans reached $61.8 billion and Discover card sales volume increased 5% from the prior year. Consumer deposits grew $3.6 billion (11%) from the prior year to $37.7 billion. Payment services’ transaction dollar volume stood at $50.1 billion. In Q2 2017, Discover Financial Services reported net income of $546 million.</p>

<p>Long story short, Discover of 2017 is a massive and, more importantly, an innovative business. One of the hallmarks of Discover is that the institution is both the network provider and an issuer. The model utilized by competitors is different – Visa and Mastercard operate networks and partner with issuers to issue issuer-specific cards. Why is this important?</p>

<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/overview-of-the-payments-industry/">Revenue models applied to financial instruments</a> are complex, and they include a variety of fees – transactional, flat fees, and incidental fees, each of which can be broken down into a dozen other fees. In this case, we care about <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/discovers-network-of-networks-strategy-makes-it-more-global-and-much-bigger-than-it-appears/">two</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Issuer fees: The issuers charge cardholders interest on their purchases and cash transactions. Some issuers also charge its users an annual fee just for the privilege of carrying their card. Apart from that, they also charge other potential fees – for cash advances, late payment, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Association (network) fees: Banks that issue cards with certain network providers’ brands have to pay fees to be associated with the network.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Being a network and an issuer, Discover is able to offer unique benefits to Discover cardholders that are rooted in operational efficiency and network reach.</p>

<p>Discover Network is a comprehensive, payments network accepted at millions of merchant locations in the US, Canada, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. Discover’s power is magnified by the two core networks it is built on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Diners Club International introduced the first multipurpose charge card to the world in 1950. Currently, Diners Club International has over 26 million merchant acceptance locations and 1.9 million ATM and cash access locations across 185 countries and territories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PULSE is one of the nation’s leading debit/ATM networks. PULSE provides cardholders with access to 1.8 million ATMs worldwide.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Discover is also accepted by three major mobile wallets – Apple Pay, Samsung Pay (&gt;5 million monthly customers), and Android Pay (&gt;5 million monthly users).</p>

<p>A hallmark of the Discover Network is its approach to acceptance expansion. Discover Network itself is strategically picking global partner networks to ensure the backing of the leading institutions across pan-regional markets – the ones that have the most scale and reach. More importantly, the potential of this growth is fueled by the partnerships that Discover acceptance members create themselves.</p>

<p>For example, in mid-September 2017, Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Industry and Trade (VietinBank) <a href="http://vietnamnews.vn/bizhub/393641/vietinbank-becomes-diners-club-card-issuer.html#XLRQUQ4BPXOME30w.97">signed a partnership agreement</a> to become the only issuer of Diners Club cards in Vietnam. The agreement helps to expand VietinBank’s existing acquisition relationship with Diners Club International Ltd, a business unit and wholly-owned subsidiary of Discover Financial Services and a part of the Discover Global Network. The Diners Club cards have the same issuance process and method of use as international credit and debit cards. In addition to the functions of international credit cards, such as internet payments, point-of-sale payments, withdrawals and accessing transaction history, cardholders also enjoy many discounts across more than 30 countries at restaurants, hotels and shopping centers.</p>

<p>Earlier, in January 2017, Discover Financial Services also entered a landmark <a href="https://investorrelations.discover.com/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/Discover-and-Paypal-Partner-to-Deliver-New-Digital-Payment-Experiences/default.aspx">agreement</a> with PayPal, making PayPal more widely available to Discover cardmembers, acquirers and merchants. The agreement provides PayPal access to Discover’s tokenization services, expanding PayPal’s reach at POS, which will enable US PayPal customers to pay with their Discover cards at all of the contactless-enabled merchants that accept Discover. As part of the agreement, Discover and PayPal plan to enable PayPal customers with eligible Discover cards to use their Cashback Bonus to pay for purchases at the millions of online and mobile merchants that accept PayPal. After enablement, Discover cardmembers will be able to view and use their available Cashback Bonus while using PayPal to pay for all or part of the largest card network in Brazil, Elo.</p>
