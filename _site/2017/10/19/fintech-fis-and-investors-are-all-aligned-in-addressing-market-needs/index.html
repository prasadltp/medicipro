<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-16/fintech-deals-focus-on-peer-to-peer-payments-in-busy-quarter">It was a busy quarter for deals in FinTech</a>. According to the latest report from FT Partners, banking (including P2P lending), and payments scored the most deals in the period. With innovation in facilitating convenient banking services, comes ever-accelerating fraud risk and a considerate cost at which security breaches come to companies. No wonder forward-thinking teams continue to secure financial support for advanced security solutions, and payments behemoths continue an aggressive push to make payments convenient.</p>

<h2 id="paypal-rolls-out-venmo-payments-to-its-us-retailers">PayPal rolls out Venmo payments to its US retailers</h2>

<p>This was due for a while. Now, Venmo users can pay at all online locations that accept PayPal – Pay with Venmo becomes ubiquitous. Also, every merchant that has Braintree’s payment gateway can enable Venmo. Suddenly, everyone from Forever 21, online sellers, to charities and hundreds of apps will have millennials paying via Venmo now. Over 2 million online US retailers can now accept Pay with Venmo.</p>

<p>The genius of the Braintree acquisition is also fully apparent now.</p>

<p>This underscores the growing need to nail merchant payments. As P2P payments had been a big focus on the past with Venmo, merchant payments will be the big focus in next few years.</p>

<p>Not to forget, there’s also PayPal’s consumer purchase protection. The ability to split bills later on Venmo and every transaction shared on Venmo, which doubles up as a payments social network of sorts, is beautiful.</p>
