<h3 id="singapore-moves-forward-with-blockchain-powered-interbank-payments-project">Singapore Moves Forward With Blockchain-Powered Interbank Payments Project</h3>

<p>The software prototypes of three different models for decentralized interbank payment and settlements have been successfully developed by the blockchain consortium led by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state’s central bank and financial regulator, and the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS).</p>

<p>The project, conducted together with 11 financial institutions and five technology companies, is the Phase 2 of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/singapore-central-bank-uses-ethereum-digitalize-national-currency/">Project Ubin</a>, which explored the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) for clearing and settlement of payments and securities.</p>

<p>Project Ubin was triggered in late-2016 with an aim to better understand blockchain and its potential benefits through practical experimentation. MAS has said that “digital central bank issued tokens” could enable the development of simpler to use and more efficient alternatives to today’s systems.</p>

<p>In Singapore, OCBC Bank, HSBC, and MUFG are already working on a <a href="https://www.ocbc.com/assets/pdf/media/2017/october/media%20release%20-%20ocbc%20hsbc%20and%20mufg%20together%20with%20imda%20complete%20proof%20of%20concept%20on%20aseans%20first%20industry%20kyc%20blockchain_web.pdf">KYC blockchain project</a> to eliminate the duplicity of KYC processes and provide more convenience to customers and efficiency across the banks.</p>
