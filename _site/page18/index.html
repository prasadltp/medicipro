          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Bitcoin hits new highs, big FinTech firms flock to the cryptocurrency to meet consumer demand. Whether this is an attempt to ride the wave, or out of sincere belief in the future of cryptocurrency, Square's beta of cryptocurrency trading is certainly a positive sign for the affectionate community. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Square Cash is letting some users buy and sell Bitcoin</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Square is </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/11/14/square-cash-a-new-place-to-buy-and-sell-bitcoin/#70a568277194%C2%A0%E2%80%A6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">testing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cryptocurrency support in their Cash app. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trial, available right now to a small number of users, lets users buy and sell Bitcoin directly in the app. Users who have access to the beta can swipe right from the Cash Card page to access Bitcoin functionality.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Square is likely using pooled wallets to hold user funds and not storing private keys on a user’s device, similar to how Coinbase works.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the feature is centered around buying and selling Bitcoin and not sending and receiving. There’s a (potentially non-functioning) option to generate an address to receive Bitcoin, but no option to send it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re always listening to our customers and we’ve found that they are interested in using the Cash app to buy Bitcoin. We’re exploring how Square can make this experience faster and easier, and have rolled out this feature to a small number of Cash app customers. We believe cryptocurrency can greatly impact the ability of individuals to participate in the global financial system and we’re excited to learn more here.” – Square Spokesperson.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICBC, the nation’s largest bank by assets becomes the first of China’s ‘big four’ lenders to offer automated advice and product service. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICBC launches robo-adviser service for wealth-management products</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICBC has applied the latest AI-led technology to its wealth-management operations. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its newly launched robo-adviser service will see computer programs dish out investment advice to retail investors over its mobile banking platform, becoming the first among the nation’s “big four” state-owned lenders to unlock the potential of the hot new service being adopted rapidly by the industry, worldwide.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The value of China’s total robo-adviser services (banks + asset managers + FinTech) is expected to top US $783 billion by 2020. Globally, the segment is projected to reach US $6.5 trillion by 2025, up from US $100 billion in 2016. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICBC is the nation’s largest bank by assets, but small- and mid-sized mainland banks have already tested such services. </span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alibaba smashes its Single’s Day record once again as sales cross $25 billion</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alibaba has set another Single’s Day record after the e-commerce giant sold over $25 billion in GMV on the Chinese biggest online shopping date.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alibaba handled 1.48 billion transactions during the 24-hour period – a 39% increase in last year’s sales total of RMB $17.79 billion.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s 11/11 got off to a fast start with around $7 billion of goods sold in the first 30 minutes of the day alone. Alibaba went on to surpass last year’s $18 billion total after just 12 hours of sales.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 90% of sales were made on mobile which is up on 82% for 2016 and 69% in 2015.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total order numbers hit 812 million, up 23%.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">167 merchants generated over $15.1 million in sales each.</span></li>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global expansion isn’t always easy – just ask Target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help kick off its expansion efforts into Canada, the retail giant took over the leases to</span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703583404576079690417970136"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">220 Zellers locations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2011. About four years later, Target made a hasty retreat from the Great White North, shuttering its Canadian business almost overnight. Of course, this kind of expansion blunder (which cost the company </span><a href="http://fortune.com/2015/04/02/target-canada-store-closing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">roughly $7 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) isn’t unique to Target. Other well-known companies – such as eBay and Best Buy – have faced their own struggles during forays abroad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a marketplace looking to expand, how can you avoid a similar fate? Reduce the risk with data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Far too often, businesses rely on ill-informed strategies that don’t provide the greatest shot at global success. The </span><a href="http://expansion.hyperwallet.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 Marketplace Expansion Index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help fill that knowledge gap. Instead of basing international growth decisions solely on a country’s proximity or payment infrastructure, the Index leverages 10 key factors – including ease of doing business, the level of English proficiency, and retail e-commerce market size – to gauge the expansion-readiness of 36 different countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of the countries is divided into three tiers based on their attractiveness: established, emerging and evolving. But just because a country is in the “established” category doesn’t mean it’s a good fit for your business. Here’s a look at five emerging countries that may better align with your company’s unique strengths and weaknesses.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Belgium</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancing is far from a foreign concept in Belgium. In fact, about 30% of Belgians already do some sort of freelancing work in their spare time. The emergence of robust payment and logistics infrastructure will likely make it even easier for </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/how-fintech-serves-gig-economy-and-workforce/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gig economy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies to scale locally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For service-based platforms, however, things may get little tricky. Steep social security taxes coupled with the second-highest corporate tax rate in Europe may quickly stunt business growth. Minimize human support to free up resources where necessary.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Sweden</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweden isn’t known for its size. With a population size of about</span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-05/watch-out-sweden-hits-10-million-people"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">10 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people, Sweden ranks well behind other expansion destinations. But when it comes to payments, the Scandinavian nation more than makes up for its small-but-growing population. Given the country’s exceptional payments and logistics infrastructure, nearly 99% of the workforce receives their paychecks directly into a bank account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swedes have also fully embraced the sharing economy. Around a third of the population has participated in the sharing economy at one point or another. From furniture to kitchen appliances, there’s almost no limit to what Swedes are willing to rent.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Hong Kong</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For goods-based marketplaces, </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/hong-kong-home-european-fintech-startups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hong Kong is the place to be</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. More than 85% of transactions involve cross-border movement – the highest in any country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acceptance of the sharing economy, however, is a different story. Despite the fact that 82% of Hong Kong citizens have been consumers of sharing economy activities, heavy regulations continue to stunt the industry’s growth. In May 2017, more than</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-tech-hongkong-arrests/hong-kong-police-arrest-21-uber-drivers-idUSKBN18J0GG"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">20 Uber drivers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were arrested on the suspicion of illegally carrying passengers for hire and not having third-party insurance. Businesses aiming to enter Hong Kong’s sharing economy need to keep a close eye on changes within this protectionist regulatory environment.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Israel</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although political unrest has plagued Israel at times, the country remains a hotbed for sharing economy startups. From Gett to Juno, a number of Israeli-developed ride-sharing platforms have launched successful pilot projects. Since Israel’s customer base is especially receptive to new services and goods marketplaces, there’s plenty of opportunity for innovation. Only speak English? No problem. Israel boasts a large English-speaking population that spends more time online per capita than people living anywhere else. Businesses that cater to this increasingly digital consumer base can quickly move one step ahead of the competition.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Malaysia</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like Israel, Malaysia has suffered the brunt of political turmoil in recent years. A scandal surrounding the</span><a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/365551"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1Malaysia Development Berhad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (1MDB) fund has caused the ringgit – Malaysia’s most prominent currency – to regularly fluctuate in value. Still, though, emerging digital platforms would be wise to consider expansion into Malaysia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a growing unemployment rate, Malaysian workers are more eager to pick up digital work than ever before. And by 2020, digital economy activities could contribute toward nearly one-fifth of Malaysia’s domestic productivity. Don’t miss your chance to take advantage of this burgeoning digital economy.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make no mistake – marketplace expansion is a significant undertaking. But if done right, it can help your company reach new heights. From surveying local competition to gauging e-commerce activity, give your business the best chance at expansion success by keeping strategic marketplace factors in mind.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduction of default and interest</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, the default rate in Mexico for personal loans was between 3.1% and 5%. With the Zetra platform, according to company data, the default rate is currently around 1.60% for the company eNomina. Out of the countries where Zetra operates, Mexico is the only market that already had a payroll loan format similar to Brazil's.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to reducing default rates, the company manages to reduce interest rates in new markets. "We launched the SalaryFits platform in Portugal, and the partner bank provided consumer credit at an average of 9 to 11% interest per year. Through the platform and through the use of the application, we have been able to reduce the interest offered by half," said Amorim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, Amorim talks about the implementation of the operation in other countries.</span></p>

<p><b>Are there many differences between the operation of a FinTech in Brazil and in other countries?</b></p>
<p><b>Álvaro Amorim:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> People are starting to ride this FinTech wave now in Brazil. In other countries, it is already more than reality. In Brazil, there is an excess of bureaucracy but the Central Bank is open for discussions and even consulted the public on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zetra is fully compliant with the Central Bank’s requirements for lending businesses. </span></p>
<p><b>What challenges does your company need to overcome when expanding into new markets? </b></p>
<p><b>AA: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, we bring the concept of the new product in order to strategically establish the platform with the link between the payroll and the credit provider.</span></p>
<p><b>What is Zetra's largest market outside Brazil?</b></p>
<p><b>AA:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Today, Zetra's second-largest market is in Mexico, and its India project is the most audacious. With regard to numbers, India will certainly be the largest scale that we will achieve. The platform aims to facilitate financial inclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per recent findings, only 23% of the population has access to banking and credit supply. The operation in India is already a year old. We will wait until the end of the year to run the pilot, and I believe that by the end of 2018, we will have an interesting scale there. [SalaryFits is one of the 20 startups of </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/india-fintech-awards-2017-meet-top-fintech-startups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">India FinTech Awards 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">].</span></p>
<p><b>How is it possible to reduce interest rates in new markets?</b></p>
<p><b>AA:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The reduction of interest rates becomes natural with the process established through the platform. When we provide digital channels where the financial institution has access to a larger number of new customers and also has data from the payroll that the bank previously would not have access to, we create a new access model risk. That is an upgrade on the credit score.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We still count on the presence of the employer. It guarantees that at the end of every month, the employer will make the payment on behalf of the employee, who receives the salary already with the discount. Even the effort for the bank to sell the loan is practically zero since the offer is all digital.</span></p>
