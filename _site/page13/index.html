          <a href="/fintech/insights/mobile/transactions/2017/11/28/the-secret-sauce/" class="post-link"><h3 class="h1 post-title">The Secret Sauce</h3></a>
          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a historical basis for establishing that money – fiat, commodity or otherwise – is a state-backed utility. And for good reason! What is more important is the understanding and agreement that this has to become the basis of evolving cashless from cash rather than cash-replacement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The secret sauce to get us to the holy grail of ubiquitous m-transactions – for finance, retail, health and government applications – can be summarized into the following five guiding principles:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Commerce has evolved on several fronts. The marketplace is truly multidimensional and global with large but nevertheless cliques, and hence, its own set of challenges. Channels continue to evolve as do the means of access, and while the fundamental constructs of commerce remain the same, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">new transaction rails will have to ensure frictionless cash-in and cash-out</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> despite our intent on moving towards a cashless environment. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Even with an expanded definition, m-transactions will continue to evolve around buyers and sellers, around credentials and tokens, and around privacy and identity. Underscoring all of this expansion and evolution will be the ePlumbing, or stated differently, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">an authorization infrastructure based on a universally accepted but distributed form of identity that is capable of issuing and settling a multitude of tokens – permanent and temporary – for finance, retail, health, education, and government applications across all channels, devices, and data elements</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If we get this ePlumbing wrong, everything else we try to build on top of it will not stand the test of time.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. With all the great technological progress and the overarching potential and promise of m-transactions, we continue to struggle with figuring out how to drive adoption. We have been guaranteed the wrong answers, as we have consistently failed to ask the right questions – questions we believe that should be framed around the overall experience to help</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">simplify the experience by</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> leveraging contextual and behavioral intelligence, where applications lead transactions to help achieve a seamless experience across all channels and devices</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Other questions that we will need to address as we try to answer the above are: “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What exactly is the seamless experience?”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the most effective way of ensuring that an individual’s privacy becomes the responsibility of the entire community</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?”</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. While usability will drive adoption, the utility will ensure scale. The exercise we now need to undertake is of finding the fine line that will demarcate the utility from the usability. Once we do that, we can effectively </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">define and deploy a cross-industry utility that will ensure scale, upon which a highly innovative usability environment can then help drive adoption, collectively addressing all the relevant technology, business, and regulatory issues related to seamless personalized transactions</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of us will revel in the trees and some of us will enjoy taking on the entire forest. What we can state decisively is that we will need both: the deep domain experts as well as the broad visionaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is also interesting is as we step back and connect all of these dots, the picture starts to look very different. A true cashless environment is achievable provided we perceive it to be so, for the objects of sense exist only when they are perceived. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, the real issue is one of perception.</span></p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://sp17.nextmoney.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next Money Global Conference Edition São Paulo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> held at the beginning of November (the only one in Latin America), brought together entrepreneurs, technology, and financial companies, specialists and investors. One of the most commented themes in various panels, even when it was not the main theme, was blockchain, which also relates to the themes of other panels, such as cryptocurrency and ICO (Initial Coin Offering). Executives of the companies like </span><a href="https://latoex.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latoex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://consensys.net/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consensys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.r3.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">R3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.coinbr.net/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinBR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://foxbit.exchange/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foxbit,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://alphaledger.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alpha Ledger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> participated in these discussions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who wanted to know more about the financial innovations produced in the country had a full day with the presentation of the FinTech competitors in the FF18 (besides, of course, the FinTechs participating in the panels, which are already relevant in their sectors). In the panels were companies such as </span><a href="http://www.creditas.com.br/%E2%80%8E"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creditas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.zetrasoft.com.br/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zetra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (credit), </span><a href="https://beetech.global/en.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beetech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (currency exchange and remittances), </span><a href="https://foxbit.exchange/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foxbit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> e </span><a href="https://www.coinbr.net/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinBR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Bitcoin). The panels were moderated by </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-diniz-a9540a11/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno Diniz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Co-founder of </span><a href="http://www.spiralem.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spiralem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelo-bradaschia-937100/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcelo Bradaschia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christina-orssich-hutchinson-b857019/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christina Hutchinson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were also among the participating experts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the panel on ICO's, Fernando Bresslau, Country Manager of </span><a href="https://www.ripio.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ripio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Brazil (formerly BitPagos, from Argentina), shared the case of the company. Ripio raised the equivalent of US $32 million with its token, based on the cryptocurrency Ethereum, which was sold in early November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brazilian FinTechs </span><a href="https://www.swapy.network/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swapy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://originalmy.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OriginalMY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have already released their white papers – documents detailing the process of issuing tokens and the company plans for the investment received – for their ICOs that are expected to happen soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the apparent market excitement with blockchain technology, Edilson Osório Jr., CEO of OriginalMY argues that its use should be considered on a case-by-case basis. "The question is if you can do today without being on blockchain. If you can do that, you don’t have to do it on blockchain," he explained.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional companies and innovation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional companies show that they are not only following but also developing innovative initiatives internally. This is the case, for example, of Banco do Brasil, which has made some of its open banking projects available to Beta customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Pedro Begotti from Banco do Brasil, there are also initiatives mapped on the institution's innovation platform that have not yet been launched, and many will be launched shortly. "The structure we have built in the bank is already complete. What is missing is a change in the business model," Begotti added, talking about how innovations can change the role of large banks in the dynamics of the financial market in the country. Banks would have to adapt their business model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commenting on open banking, Microsoft's Head of Financial Services Adriano Bottas, brought up the European model, known as PSD2, as an example. "More than a 360º view of your customer, it allows you to have a 720º view, with the authorization of the client, through the exchange of data between institutions," he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speakers agreed that the exchange of data can benefit customers who will have an offer of more services geared to their needs. In addition, open banking reduces risks to the institutions, which will have more information about consumers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">FF18 – Global Competition for Financial Innovation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup winner of this edition – </span><a href="https://smarttbot.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smarttbot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an investment robot platform that executes strategies in an automated way – goes to the semifinal at Next Money Hong Kong in December. </span></p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-Thanksgiving week has been rich on interesting updates across sectors, some of which represent a significant push in adopting new technology, embracing startup partnerships, and expansions into new niches and markets.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lending updates</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeking bigger US presence, Barclays joins crowded online lending market</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">As part of a broader effort to build out its US consumer business, London-based Barclays is now offering unsecured personal loans online, targeting prime and super-prime borrowers. It has been testing its online lending platform with select US customers since late last year and plans to roll it out in full force in 2018.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Barclays’ personal loans typically range between $5,000 and $35,000 and can be repaid in three, four or five years. The interest rates range from 4.99% to 18.99% and the loans carry no origination fees or prepayment penalties.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The bank has made roughly 15,000 personal loans to date. The consumers Barclays is targeting are interested in using the loans for things like debt consolidation and home improvements.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Barclays has made the entire process – from application to funding – entirely digital and gives borrowers near-instant decisions on loan applications. It is also adding its own features, like giving borrowers (or prospective borrowers) access to a customer service representative should they need help during the loan process.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">In China, Unsecured Short-Term Lending Now a Trillion-Yuan Industry</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The unsecured short-term loans in China are ballooning – these loans have already surpassed the 1 trillion yuan ($151 billion) mark. It is projected that the total amount of unsecured short-term loans in 2017 is set to be six times more than in 2016.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Credit risks are building up, as borrowers have been found taking out loans from one lender to roll over previous loans from another, snowballing their debt. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">As of Sunday, there were 2,693 online platforms offering short-term loans to nearly 10 million clients. The average size of such a loan was 1,400 yuan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Most “cash loan” platforms, defined as those that offer unsecured loans with loan periods of six months or less, charge annualized rates of interest that exceed 100% despite advertising seemingly low daily interest rates.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Two million clients have taken out loans from more than one platform in the same month. Half a million of these borrowers took out loans from more than 10 platforms within the same month. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Because of easy access to loans, clients are typically low-income individuals that find it difficult to get loans from the formal banking system. Threats and even violence are often used to claim outstanding loans.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">1,044 platforms for short-term unsecured loans operated through websites, 860 through WeChat public accounts, and 429 through apps.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Nearly 600 P2P websites also offered unsecured short-term loans, accounting for about 16% of all P2P platforms. This compares with 812 online lending platforms that offered unsecured short-term loans, making up about 37% of all online lending platforms.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payments updates</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers can now invoice buyers through PayPal’s new chat extension for Messenger</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">PayPal and Facebook are expanding their integrations with the launch of an extension for Messenger that allows PayPal sellers to invoice buyers directly through private messaging. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch comes on the heels of </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/20/you-can-now-paypal-friends-in-messenger-and-get-help-via-chat/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last month’s debut of P2P PayPal payments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Messenger, and the arrival of PayPal’s first customer service Messenger bot for handling customer questions and requests for help.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">With this integration, the focus is on shifting small business transactions and those between buyers and sellers into Messenger.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank of America's P2P Payments Business Almost Doubled in October</span></h3>
