          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LTP Team had the pleasure of speaking with </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-e-tavares-534201aa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juan E. Tavares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Co-founder &amp; Chief Strategy Officer at </span><a href="https://www.lendingpoint.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LendingPoint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Juan works to distill stories from data, leverage investor relations, and nurture new opportunities in the lending market. Seizing the opportunity to bring LendingPoint to the American market, Juan points to the economy’s reshaping of the financial services industry, resulting in new regulatory environments for lenders and new challenges for consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope you enjoy our conversation with Juan as much as we did.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><i>Photo: </i><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-e-tavares-534201aa/"><i>Juan E. Tavares</i></a><i>, Co-founder &amp; Chief Strategy Officer at LendingPoint</i></strong></p>
<p><b>LTP Team: Juan, please tell us about yourself.</b></p>
<p><b>Juan E. Tavares: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe FinTech is the ultimate tool for financial inclusion and upward mobility – the solutions that arise at the intersection of data and technology have the potential to level the playing field financially for underserved segments of the population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helping entrepreneurs tap into unlocked potential was my first experience with FinTech. As the US economy fell to its knees after the ’08 crisis, my partner Victor Pacheco and I were contacted by CAN Capital to help them scale their technology beyond the US borders. We formed a partnership that launched Avanzame Latin America, headquartered in the Dominican Republic, in the Spring of 2010. The organization grew to become the most successful SMB lender in the Caribbean and was recently acquired by Banco Popular Dominicano. Since the acquisition, the bank has continued to leverage the platform to democratize access to credit for entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, I moved to the United States from the Dominican Republic to co-founded </span><a><span style="font-weight: 400;">LendingPoint,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alongside my partners Victor Pacheco, Tom Burnside, and Franck Fatras. We’re back at it again, this time around helping consumers whose credit story is not understood by other lenders. We’ve chosen to serve the “NearPrime” market, which consists of nearly 50 million Americans with credit scores between 600 and 700, who have essentially fallen victim to the market’s slow response to help them tap into their potential.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP Team: Give us a paragraph pitch for your company.</b></p>
<p><b>Juan E. Tavares:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> LendingPoint is a FinTech balance sheet lender with a vision to revolutionize access to credit – by leveling the playing field for the NearPrime borrower and democratizing access to credit. There are three critical things to understand about our company:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We chose to listen to the voice of the NearPrime borrower because it is a segment of the market that has been both underserved and misunderstood, and because our business exists to expand access to credit;</span></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the marketplace lender, our balance sheet approach means that we maintain credit risk and the relationship with the consumer, so we’re encouraged to lend more responsibly;</span></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are credit-first: we have been quietly building out the systems, technology, credit models, and partner networks necessary to win in the marketplace because we focus on sound credit practices first and foremost. Our unique, credit first approach to lending uses data and technology to tell credit stories about borrowers who other lenders don’t understand. Our algorithms look beyond a credit score, focusing on both on the relationship with the individual and the future potential while looking for more reasons to say “yes.”</span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>LTP Team: In a sentence or two, what problems are you solving today?</b></p>
<p><b>Juan E. Tavares:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> LendingPoint provides access to affordable credit for these NearPrime consumers, helping them to build and improve their credit profiles. There is a great divide that happens at the 700 FICO score. Access to credit is no problem for so-called Prime customers with scores above 700 – they get the lowest interest rates and the best reward programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the rest of the population, the story is different – they don’t qualify for traditional bank loans, and a lot of times, they’re left with little to no options beyond predatory lenders, expensive subprime products, and sky-high interest rates. LendingPoint provides access to affordable credit for these NearPrime consumers, helping them to build and improve their credit profiles. </span></p>
<p><b>LTP Team: Who are you selling to?</b></p>
<p><b>Juan E. Tavares: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We offer loans to NearPrime consumers – people with credit scores between 600 and 700. We have identified unique behavior patterns that bring these consumers together as one asset class: some may be working-class Americans, and others may be millennials looking to establish credit for the first time. We look at creditworthiness beyond their FICO scores, discovering characteristics that are more distinctive and tell a broader story about a person’s potential, not just their past. So whether they’re planning a dream vacation or a dream wedding; a home renovation or a cross-country move; or need access to money for debt consolidation or medical expenses – LendingPoint offers transparent terms that take the guesswork out of repayment.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP Team: How does LendingPoint differentiate from competitors?</b></p>
<p><b>Juan E. Tavares: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of today’s FinTech lenders are “capital-light and credit last.” As a credit-first FinTech balance sheet lender, a constellation of differences sets LendingPoint apart. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While other alternative lenders focus primarily on customer acquisition and front-end user experience (with credit fundamentals being secondary), LendingPoint is a credit-first lender. We never lose sight of the fundamentals of sound credit modeling. This approach allows us to approve more creditworthy customers and provide lower, more transparent rates than our competitors (14.9%-35% APR) – all while achieving lower charge-off rates, lower cost of acquisition, and higher profitability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, LendingPoint is a balance sheet lender, which means that we maintain the credit risk and the relationship with the borrower (vs. the marketplace model, where the loans are originated for third-party investors). We have a vested interest in making sure the loan performs – so with us, consumers get better, more transparent terms, and investors see better returns. There is a real alignment of interest that is rarely seen in alternative lending.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP Team: Your next milestone?</b></p>
<p><b>Juan E. Tavares:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In </span><a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/03/prweb14123513.htm#!"><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnership with FinWise Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we are continuing to expand our services nationwide with standardized rates, loan agreements, product portfolios, marketing, and services. We’re now operational in 30 states plus the District of Columbia, and we’re continuing to expand nationwide. This gives us a great platform for building partnerships with other entities that have a similar customer strategy – companies that are on a mission to help consumers who’ve been left behind by traditional banking services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because we’ve done the hard work of becoming a successful credit-first, balance sheet lender, we can now solve the credit problem for many companies at the point of access where their consumers need it. So, we’re busy exploring partnerships with retailers, small businesses, and other lending marketplaces to expand our point of need strategy. Our goal is to meet people at the point where they want or need access to credit – whether they’re on a home improvement site shopping for an upcoming renovation; planning a wedding, or even building a business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent example of this type of partnership is a new product we just announced with ezVerify, called ezCarePoint. ezCarePoint helps patients verify their insurance coverage and payment responsibility for healthcare services before the procedures take place, preventing incidents where patients unexpectedly find themselves responsible for bills outside of their insurance coverage. If the patient can’t pay the out-of-pocket costs up front, they can apply for a loan &amp; payment plan quickly and easily from the ezCarePoint platform. Patients are notified of approvals in a matter of seconds, and the loan proceeds are paid directly to the medical practitioners to pay the patients’ out-of-pocket medical costs when the treatment is rendered or procedure performed. We think this product has the potential to solve the last mile problem in medical payments, and there are so many more examples of how we can provide access to credit to consumers in the moments they need it most.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP Team: What do you envision for the future of alternative finance?</b></p>
<p><b>Juan E. Tavares: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech is here to stay, but the landscape will continue to evolve. After the Great Recession, tech-enabled lenders stepped in to meet the growing customer demand for credit, but they didn’t have a credit-first model, and for the past decade not a single one has brought a solution to market that takes care of customers as well as investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These “capital-light, credit-last” tech-enabled platforms have proven not to be sustainable on a standalone basis, and thus, I think they will continue to fall out of favor with investors. Instead, the market will reward three things:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Unique origination channels at the point-of-need;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Credit performance; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Profitability.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech Balance Sheet Lenders like LendingPoint are in the best position to deliver on this trifecta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past 10 years, some have said that FinTech’s promise was to help in the recovery of the consumers and the economy by displacing banks; this clearly has not happened, and I don’t believe it would or should. Instead, the next 10 years will be about a “Great Conversion,” where FinTech companies – those that serve unique markets, with robust credit disciplines and sustainable business models – will become attractive partners for banks. I envision an ecosystem of greater collaboration between FinTech innovation and traditional banking, not an ongoing competition between incumbents and disruptors.</span></p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the culture of convenience pushes boundaries across segments, banking sees accelerating adoption of biometrics as the way to access personal accounts – Spanish heavyweight BBVA inches closer to Samsung to bring the biometric authentication on Android devices to its banking app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">BBVA, the first bank with access to its mobile app via iris scanning, thanks to Samsung</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">On Nov. 16, 2017, Samsung and BBVA presented the iris scanning feature, which will allow BBVA customers with Samsung-compatible smartphones to log on to the bank’s Spanish mobile banking app just by looking at their displays.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">BBVA becomes the first Spanish bank to deploy Samsung’s advanced biometric authentication technology, Samsung Pass, which will permit customers to bypass cumbersome login/password authentication methods. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Iris recognition is currently considered to be the most secure form of identity verification.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Samsung Pass, based on FIDO (Fast Identity Online) technology, frees the user from having to write identifiers and passwords to start each session. </span></li>

<hr />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BBVA is not really the first bank to allow users access to their accounts through iris scan. This year, </span><a href="http://finovate.com/samsung-power-biometric-authentication-pilot-bank-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank of America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/2017/09/biometric-banking-how-to-log-into-your-bank-account-with-your-eyes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TBS bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are also on one stage or the other with adopting similar technology for app access.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sensory, Fujitsu Partner to Bring Face Biometrics to Banking, Enterprise, Retail</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sensory Inc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">., a Silicon Valley company enhancing user experience and security for consumer electronics, announces that it has partnered with Fujitsu Limited to assist more banks, financial institutions, enterprises and others in adopting face biometrics within their mobile apps.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Sensory’s TrulySecure™ face biometric authentication is FIDO-certified and provides users an extremely secure mobile banking experience without compromising convenience.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The first customer to be announced as a result of the Fujitsu and Sensory partnership is Mizuho Bank, which will be integrating Sensory’s TrulySecure facial recognition into their mobile banking app.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biometrics to replace PIN code in Nigeria</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has disclosed that with the Bank Verification Number (BVN) in place, biometrics will soon be used for transactions on the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) instead of the existing PIN code.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">"That means if you want to transact with your ATM, you will need to use your biometrics. There is no way you can give your finger to a third party. If that is enabling, it will make our system to be more secure and make all our transactions to be validated."</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Senior officials also said &gt;90,000 military pensioners in Nigeria are to be identified as part of a national biometric verification exercise.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credence Research forecasts biometrics in healthcare market growth</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The global healthcare biometrics market will grow at a CAGR of 22.9% to surpass $13.9 million in revenue in 2025.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Demand is increasing for optimum certainty in patient identification to reduce healthcare fraud while protecting patient data privacy and security.

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voice Biometrics, Phone and Network Imaging – A Magic Mix for Intelligent Authentication</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Eckoh, the London-based provider of global payment products and customer service solutions, will be awarded a patent that combines voice biometrics with phone ‘footprinting.’</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">When one considers that a phone ‘footprint’ is also regarded as a unique template, very much like a biometric template (voice, finger, face, etc.), this combination of factors actually satisfies all three criteria: 1) Multi-layer – speaker and device, both components that make up the ‘edge’ of a connection; 2) Multi-modal – voice and phone ‘biometrics’; 3) Multi-factor – something you are (voice) and something you ‘have’ (phone).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The application of Big Data Analytics on various network components such as the SIM card (the primary network authentication layer), phone, carrier network(s), internal enterprise systems and other nodes across the entire voice ecosystem is yielding immense improvements in caller authentication. AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon announced in September that they have joined their considerable resources to create the Mobile Authentication Taskforce, whose goal to develop mobile authentication solutions using components such as network-based device authentication, geo-location and SIM card recognition.</span></li>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MEDICI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data, Germany’s FinTech landscape counts ~475 companies. While FinTech companies in Germany collected €400 million for the whole of 2016, the inflow of capital had already reached €307 million in H1 2017. The number of deals also went up, as did the average size of the deals, rising from €7 million to €7.3 million, </span><a href="https://frankfurt-main-finance.com/en/fintech-location-germany-set-for-growth/%5C"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankfurt Main Finance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the financial center initiative for Frankfurt am Main, reports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The full market potential for FinTechs in Germany is estimated at €1.7 trillion (€380 billion in financings and €1.3 trillion in wealth management). Of this market, FinTechs are expected to catch relatively moderate €58 billion in 2020, €97 billion in 2025, and €148 billion in 2035 (base case), according to the </span><a href="http://financialinstitutions.bakermckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2017/06/Baker_McKenzie-Fintech_regulation_comparison_June2017.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Comparative FinTech Overview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in June 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The edition emphasizes that the regions of Berlin and Rhine-Main-Neckar (led by Frankfurt) in particular are consolidating their status as FinTech hotspots within Germany. In fact, in November 2016, the </span><a href="https://frankfurt-main-finance.com/en/german-government-appoints-financial-centre-frankfurt-digital-hub-for-fintech/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">German federal government designated the Financial Center Frankfurt the digital hub for FinTech and financial services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of their greater digital hubs initiative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As part of the national IT summit in November 2016, the German federal government named Frankfurt one of five digital hubs across Germany. The Frankfurt digital hub focuses on the financial services and FinTech industries and is supported by Darmstadt, whose focus is on cybersecurity,” the Ministry of Economics, Energy, Transport &amp; Regional Development emphasizes in the </span><a href="https://frankfurt-main-finance.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HTI17021-Fintech-170427_highres.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brochure reviewing Germany’s leading FinTech ecosystem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Frankfurt’s strong appeal to banks makes the region even more interesting for FinTechs,” </span><a href="https://frankfurt-main-finance.com/en/fintech-location-germany-set-for-growth/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hubertus-v%C3%A4th-11976557/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hubertus Väth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Managing Director of Frankfurt Main Finance. “The EU’s leading financial center is well-placed to attract FinTechs and become a leading location for young, innovative and agile companies. It is a matter of further enhancing the location’s appeal to FinTechs. Frankfurt and the Rhine-Main-Neckar region are facing global competition, and for the foreseeable future, London is likely to remain the benchmark in Europe against which company founders will judge us. In particular, we still need to improve in terms of our openness to cooperation with company founders, the social acceptance of failure and subsequent new starts, and the tax treatment of venture capital losses sustained.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://frankfurt-main-finance.com/en/financial-centre/advantages-of-the-location/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankfurt is home to the European Central Bank and more than 200 banks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (of which 161 are foreign). The Rhine-Main Region is one of Europe’s strongest economic regions and home to top-class higher education and research institutions. More than </span><a href="https://www.invest-in-hessen.com/mm/16_03_17_DaZa_2016_EN_PRINT.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">90%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the total German stock market turnover is earned in the financial center of Frankfurt. The euro currency sector is managed by the ECB in Frankfurt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankfurt has gained momentum after a string of banks — including Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Nomura and Standard Chartered — opted to beef up their operations in the German financial capital, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">FT </span></i><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f7397d3c-ce03-11e7-b781-794ce08b24dc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Frankfurt, </span><a href="https://www.invest-in-hessen.com/mm/HTAI_We_are_Hessen_en_screen.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">~50</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investment firms broker financing deals between companies that need capital and investors in search of returns. “Frankfurt invests a great deal, not only from the public purse but above all from the private sector as well,” </span><a href="https://frankfurt-main-finance.com/en/fintech-money-map-frankfurt-is-catching-up-to-the-fintech-revolution/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drsmolinski/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Remigiusz Smolinski</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an innovation expert at the Commerzbank subsidiary </span><a href="https://www.comdirect.de/cms/ueberuns/en/unternehmen/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comdirect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Various firms from the financial sector have created incubators, accelerators, labs, and similar playgrounds to promote FinTech business models. Notable examples of supportive spaces include </span><a href="https://www.techquartier.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechQuartier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.acceleratorfrankfurt.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accelerator Frankfurt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.main-incubator.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">main incubator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (+ </span><a href="http://www.between-the-towers.com/en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between the Towers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> initiative), </span><a href="http://www.thespot.tech/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Spot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, FinTech Hub by Deutsche Börse, </span><a href="https://lab.fintechgroup.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech Lab by FinTech Group AG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.vabn.de/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VABN by Aurelis Real Estate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not mentioning </span><a href="https://www.startupdigest.com/digests/frankfurtrheinmain"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regular events organized by entities supporting entrepreneurs, developers and other tech talent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The opening of TechQuartier marks the culmination of nearly a year’s work from the Hessen Ministry for Economics and the FinTech Dialogue Forum, which was initiated by Frankfurt Main Finance. Financial support for TechQuartier has come from a broad base of large banks and consulting firms. Platinum Sponsors include Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Börse, DZ Bank, Helaba and ING-DiBa. Gold Sponsors are Sparda-Bank Hessen, Allen &amp; Overy, EY, KPMG and PWC,” </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankfurt Main Finance</span></i> <a href="https://frankfurt-main-finance.com/en/frankfurt-fintech-report-4/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the end of 2016. “For the first time, Frankfurt now offers foreign FinTechs and startups an attractive place to start their business in Germany and prepare for their entry to the European market.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the global scene, the </span><a href="https://startupservices.startupblink.com/ecosystem-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startup Ecosystem Ranking October 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> featuring 125 countries and 950 cities, places Germany on the fifth place following the US (first), UK (second), Canada (third), and Israel (fourth). Rankings are drawn from thousands of data points gathered since 2014, and provide an accumulative score across three verticals: the quality of startups, quantity of startups, and business environment. The report suggests that Germany as a country is enjoying a startup renaissance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from Berlin, which came fifth in the global city ranking, Germany has three additional cities in the top 100, starting with Munich, Hamburg, and Frankfurt (in ascending order).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Four cities in the top 100 is a great achievement, showing the diversity of the German startup ecosystem. On quantity and activity levels, Germany has closed the gap with the UK and Canada, and its next expected leap will happen when the ecosystem generates more unicorns and exits,” according to the report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Frankfurt cannot yet claim to be the hottest FinTech hub in Europe, it certainly is on the way to a much more prominent role in bringing out the best of technological advancements into the business world. Large corporations are some of the most active supporters of the local tech talent. A year ago, Deutsche Bank opened its own innovation discovery and adoption engine – </span><a href="https://www.db.com/newsroom_news/2016/medien/deutsche-bank-opens-digital-factory-in-frankfurt-en-11701.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Digital Factory in Frankfurt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – with the goal for the Digital Factory to be a driver in innovation, digitalization, and re-engineering of the bank. “The Deutsche Bank Labs discover and evaluate new ideas. At the Digital Factory, we translate these ideas into real products and services for our clients,” said </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kim-hammonds-29848a4/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim Hammonds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Member of the Management Board of Deutsche Bank and Group Chief Operating Officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October 2014, Commerzbank, an international commercial bank with branches and offices in more than 50 countries, found </span><a href="http://www.commerzventures.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommerzVentures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Frankfurt) as a corporate VC entity with focus on FinTech. CommerzVentures backs early- and growth-stage companies in the financial services and insurance sectors, starting at Series A. For its portfolio companies, the fund offers access to key decision makers within Commerzbank Group and other relevant players in banking and insurance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another leading institution, Deutsche Börse, launched its own instrument to nurture innovation in FinServ. </span><a href="http://www.venture-network.com/dbvn-en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deutsche Börse Venture Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched with 69 partners (27 companies and 42 investors) in April 2015. Having invested $718.46 million within a year from the launch, Deutsche Börse opened The FinTech in Frankfurt in April 2016 to promote early-stage FinTech companies. In September 2016, the institution launched The Venture Match service that enables targeted matching of investors and businesses in current funding rounds for the first time. By January 2017, member companies reached over $1 billion in financing volume. Today, the number surpasses $1.55 billion.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p><a href="http://ba-frm.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Angels FrankfurtRheinMain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Germany‘s largest association, is among the vivid supporters of the local startup scene.
