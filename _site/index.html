              <p>I would start with a quote by Edewede Oriwoh: “The <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/internet-of-things-iot-evolution/">Internet of Things</a> is not a concept; it is a network, the true technology-enabled Network of all networks.” I truly believe that this is just the beginning we are witnessing. As per Gartner, 20.4 billion connected “things” will be in use by 2020 with consumer segment having the largest number of users (60% of the market). The IoT endpoint spending worldwide is expected to be over $2.9 trillion. The cross-industry devices, such as those targeted at smart buildings (including LED lighting, HVAC, and physical security systems) will be in demand as connectivity is driven into higher-volume, lower-cost devices.</p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p>The holidays are a major stress test for professionals supporting the retail pipeline. Every year, e-commerce retailers (eTailers) vow to fight the wave of holiday fraud better than the year before without turning away good business. Now they must also prepare to defend themselves against more overall fraud attacks; they can expect <a href="https://www.aciworldwide.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2017/january/global-fraud-attempts-increased-by-31-during-holiday-shopping-season">fraud attempts</a> to jump by 30% or more – much like they did in 2016. One of the biggest challenges eTailers face is recognizing criminals hiding amongst the higher volume of shopping during peak season. Another key challenge is anticipating a fraudster’s tactics, which become increasingly sophisticated to fool businesses out of goods and services.</p>
