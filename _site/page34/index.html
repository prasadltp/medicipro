              <p>McDonald’s, globally one of the most visible brands, has more than 36,000 restaurants in 120 countries and revenues of more than $24 billion. While we may ridicule the gastronomical sophistication of their menu and debate the nutritional value of their quarter pounder with cheese, there is no denying the fact that it is one of the world’s most popular fast food destinations. About 70 million people attest to that every single day.</p>

I’d imagine it’s something like blockchain, AI, ML, cloud, UX/CX, robo-advisors, digitization, and mobile-first. It’s as if the tech is the evolution. It’s not – at least not for financial services. The “tech” in FinTech only has to be leveraged in the right way to make a difference to customers. That’s it. That’s the only requirement. For that matter, it doesn’t even have to be cutting-edge, new tech – at least not for most customers. Evolution is about survival, nothing more or less.
