  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world’s largest FinTech Festival took place in Singapore on November 13-17 and was attended by more than 30,000 participants from over 100 countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organized by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), in partnership with The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) and in collaboration with SingEx Holdings, the second edition of the Singapore FinTech Festival created a platform for connection, collaboration, and co-creation for the FinTech community around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new feature this year was the Investor Summit - “Deal Day”, which provided an opportunity for Singapore-based FinTech startups to access funding from a variety of local and global investors. The highlights of last year’s Festival, including the FinTech Conference, the Global FinTech Hackcelerator, the FinTech Awards, visits to innovation labs, as well as community and networking events took place again this year.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winners of the Global FinTech Hackcelerator</span></h2>
<p><b>Singapore, November 16, 2017 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced the three winners of the Global FinTech Hackcelerator. The three winners were selected from a pool of 20 finalists that presented their solutions at Demo Day, as part of the second Singapore FinTech Festival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Global FinTech Hackcelerator is a platform for problem statements collected from the financial industry to be matched with innovative market-ready solutions from around the world. This year, MAS published 100 problem statements under four categories (Customer-Facing, Financial Inclusion, RegTech, and General), and received 580 submissions from over 40 countries. Twenty teams were shortlisted by a panel of industry judges to participate in the 12-week program. The judges selected Moxtra, SQREEM, and Trunomi as winners based on their ability to address the problem statement, innovativeness in the application of technology, and ease of adoption and scalability. Each team received a cash prize of S$50,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The winners (in no order of merit):</span></p>
