          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rise of FinTech has already had huge implications for the financial services industry. From digital currency to digital deposits, financial services organizations are having to divert from their old school ways of closed, monolithic legacy applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Zelle recently launched as a response to the rapid money transfer service from Venmo. Leading banks including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase teamed up to work on a new digital payments solution for rapid money transfer – one that would outperform their existing applications built on legacy technologies. Zelle also recently</span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zelle-expands-partner-ecosystem-300541833.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a number of new technology partners, including IBM, to help accelerate the adoption of Zelle with their financial institution clients, and to help bring them into the modern era of FinTech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the established financial services players that have been dependent on legacy technology and monolithic systems that require significant overhead and lead time to deliver value, many are struggling to satisfy the needs of their customers. In order to remain competitive, this often means a complete transformation toward secure, modern, lightweight applications, which can be a major pain point for financial organizations with these legacy technologies in place. To resolve this, banks and financial institutions are quickly taking advantage of the benefits realized by undergoing a digital transformation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More and more financial services organizations are starting to embrace modern infrastructures with lightweight, mainly open-source technologies, and methodologies like DevOps and microservices, to keep up with competition from the new, agile FinTech companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To bridge the gap between legacy applications and lightweight, modern infrastructure, financial institutions, including some of the top banks in the world, are turning to application modernization toolsets to lead their digital transformations. As digital transformation strategies coalesce into reality, there are five main areas financial IT teams need to focus on:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Application modernization</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern application architectures take advantage of innovative web technologies to speed application development and delivery by giving developers and engineers end‑to‑end control. For financial services organizations, traditional approaches to content delivery can’t keep pace with ever‑increasing demands for application acceleration. To address this, these organizations can use application modernization techniques to ensure a smoother transition to mobile interfaces, faster deployment, more developer agility, and better control over computing resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is also important for organizations looking for a toolset to bridge the gap between several legacy monolithic applications and modern containerized environments. For instance, at NGINX, we’ve recently seen one of the top banks in the US use modern application technologies, including reverse proxy, authentication, requesting routing, and API gateway services to extend a monolithic application with new mobile apps for better cross‐device customer experiences.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud adoption</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critical applications require a platform that meets specific demands. These requirements can be best met cost-effectively through a combination of public cloud for on-demand scalability, private cloud for enhanced data and security protections, and dedicated servers for best-in-class performance and reliability. To meet these requirements, the most innovative enterprises have begun their transition to the hybrid cloud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for financial services organizations looking to move to a hybrid cloud, new challenges arise – from managing disparate infrastructure configurations to keeping data stores synchronized across on-premise and cloud-based servers. Organizations are building hybrid clouds with technology stacks that are not shackled with technology interoperability or vendor lock-in constraints.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving to microservices</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, financial services organizations have relied on homegrown, monolithic applications, which are easier to build in-house. However, this simple approach has huge limitations in that successful applications always grow over time. After a few years, a small, simple application will have grown into a large, complex monolith, leaving development teams in a world of pain. Any attempts at agile development and delivery will flounder as the application is overwhelmingly complex and simply too large for any single developer to fully understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many financial services organizations are solving this problem by adopting a microservices architecture pattern. Instead of building a single monstrous, monolithic application, the idea is to split your application into sets of smaller, interconnected services. Componentizing software functions like this into microservices makes it easier to scale up a project, and easier to maintain. With individual codebases for separate systems, it becomes easier for developers to reason about the effects of changing code. With individual deployments and infrastructure for different services, it becomes easier for DevOps teams to add more computing resources only where they’re needed.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replacing expensive hardware-based solutions</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be prohibitively expensive to scale up proprietary hardware‑based solutions, and dividing application development and deployment between two different teams creates needless delays in the rollout of an improved web app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if enterprises are not moving their infrastructure to the cloud, they’re increasingly adopting more flexible and agile development and deployment methods, and are finding that these provide the features and performance they need for highly available application delivery, while drastically reducing CapEx, OpEx, and even data‑center footprint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software‐based solutions also enable financial services to reduce their dependence on data centers and build out a public/private hybrid cloud with the most effective and scalable infrastructure designed for modern applications.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upgrading from Apache</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Apache HTTP server has been a solid platform for almost any web technology developed over the last 20 years, but time – and the </span><a href="https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2017/11/21/november-2017-web-server-survey.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decline in market share for the top million busiest sites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the last five years – is showing that the architectural decisions made when the code was first laid down are becoming limiting factors in its suitability for modern web demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial services organizations who built their applications on Apache are beginning to see it hit scaling and performance issues. They need a supported web server that is future‐proof for a microservices environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, we’ve recently seen a multi-billion-dollar, multinational financial services corporation migrate a large server farm running Apache and HAProxy. The huge server farm had hit significant performance and scale issues &amp; needed to transition to a more lightweight, high‐performance solution. Using advanced proxy and load‐balancing features enabled the enterprise to create a global infrastructure layer for internal applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re at a crucial point for financial services organizations that need to bring their applications into the 21st century to keep up with new competitors. It’s more important than ever for these organizations to embrace the move to modern, agile technologies like cloud, microservices, and software-based solutions. In doing so, they can take advantage of the massive customer bases they have built, along with their trusted experience, without the worry of losing out to newer, more hotly tipped offerings.</span></p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While one of the primary goals of technology is to extend and enhance the quality of services across industries to existing and previously overlooked customers, sometimes, tech innovation can have unintended consequences. One of the interesting stories to read today is about a Silicon Valley startup that attempts to tackle a complex home renting experience. Particularly, the roadblock many face in finding a new home in hot areas, such as San Francisco – the security deposit. The company brings together crowdfunding, cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and payments. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Technology That Aims to Disrupt the Security Deposit</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Rentberry, an online rental marketplace, wants tenants to pay security fees in cryptocurrency and have micro-lenders cover most of the deposit.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“Rentberry turns Craigslist into eBay,” Kriston Capps describes. The service invites potential renters to fill out comprehensive online profiles and participate in an auction-style bidding process for housing—the best offer wins. As a result, in San Francisco and San Jose, Rentberry raised rents by 5%. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Today, Rentberry lists 220,000+ properties in 4,948 cities and is used by 120,000+ people.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Rentberry claims to have found a way to make security deposits cheaper for renters, hassle-free for landlords, and majorly profitable for anonymous third parties—all using cryptocurrency.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Rentberry’s deposit scheme works like this: Landlords will now be able to use the platform’s existing online marketplace to charge a security deposit on a property, using Rentberry’s personal cryptocurrency called BERRYs. Instead of paying the deposit in full, the renters just put down the first 10% as a deductible. Then, a “community” of micro-lenders – a crowd that can range from one to thousands of people—foot the rest of the BERRY bill. Those lenders, in turn, charge renters a yearly interest rate, typically 3-4% of the deposit. As with a normal security deposit, if the landlord doesn’t note any damage at the end of the lease, the initial deductible is returned in full to the renter, and the rest goes back to the lenders.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The benefit for renters is the liberated lost potential of their security deposits. There’s $500 billion in frozen security deposits locked away in banks now.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">However, the “freezer” into which landlords park security deposits isn’t really that cold: In many states, landlords are required or advised to keep security deposits in an escrow account, where they’re also accruing value in interest. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“Security deposits remain the major reason for filings in landlord-tenant court,” said Steve White, CEO of RentPrep, a tenant screening service that has worked closely with landlords since 2007.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Most deposits cost a month or a month-and-a-half’s rent, which means that even for cheaper apartments, tenants must pay more than double their rent upfront to move in. Rentberry’s plan has the potential to offer rental opportunities to those who might otherwise be stopped by that high upfront fee, giving first-time apartment hunters a shot in a competitive market. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">By using blockchain, Rentberry allows landlords to avoid the US banking system and forego escrow accounts, even in states that require them.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rentberry’s scoring system assesses landlords and tenants based on risk level. Renters, too, are subject to reviews and ratings, as well as credit scores, eviction history, and an intensive risk-level assessment based on evaluations from third-party companies.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unicorn Rising: How This South Korean PayPal-Backed Startup Churns $1B A Month</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Viva Republica is the most disruptive FinTech startup in South Korea. After a $48 million PayPal-backed investment in March, its flagship app Toss has grown from a simple money transfer app to a platform of diverse consumer finance services generating $20 million in expected revenue in 2017.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Toss, now the fastest-growing mobile P2P payment service globally, has reached $12 billion transaction volume this year – an average $1 billion a month.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Putting that into context, Venmo, another PayPal-backed startup, took four years to reach the same rate and is currently processing $2.5 billion in monthly transactions. But Toss, with 12 million users, was able to reach that benchmark in about half the time and has sights on breaking even in the near future – a global first in the P2P payments space.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">With the customer loyalty it earned through its P2P payments, users would expect the same robust user experience across all services on Toss. That allowed them to keep its customers on the app and adopt the new services. Its core revenue stream has shifted from its original product to the creation of new savings accounts.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Within 30 days of launching a mutual fund investment feature through a partnership with Shinhan Securities, Toss contributed 30% of the company’s mutual fund sales. Toss also began showing users their own credit scores to coach them on how to manage and improve their credit scores.</span></li>

If you’re spending money through Revolut’s debit card and run out of fiat currency, it will automatically convert the necessary amount of cryptocurrency to fiat to fund your transaction.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">When the feature opens up to all users Thursday, Revolut promises to offer the most competitive rates on crypto transactions, charging only a flat, up-front 1.5% without other hidden fees that can add up to 5% to 9% on other platforms. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">In just two years, Revolut has signed up over 1,000,000 users in Europe and processed 42 million transactions, and claims to have saved customers $160 million in foreign exchange fees. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Revolut lets users send up to €5,000 per month in 16 currencies without any fee.</span></li>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LTP Team had the pleasure of interviewing </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradweisberg1/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brad Weisberg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CEO &amp; Founder of </span><a href="http://www.snapsheetapp.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapsheet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a provider of virtual claims technology used by auto insurance carriers to optimize workflows, speed up claims processes, and provide superior service to their customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope you enjoy our interview with Brad as much as we did!</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28595" src="/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-1.12.11-PM.png" alt="Helping Insurers Adjust to the New Reality of the Sharing Economy – Interview With Brad Weisberg, CEO &amp; Founder of Snapsheet" width="1480" height="1326" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Brad Weisberg, CEO &amp; Founder of Snapsheet</strong></span></p>
<p><b>LTP: Brad, a pleasure to speak with you. Please tell us a little bit about yourself. </b></p>
<p><b>Brad Weisberg: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am the CEO and Co-founder of Snapsheet, a leading provider of virtual claims technology. Before founding Snapsheet, I was drawn to the innovation and nimbleness of the startup world and served as the VP of Global Sales at Where I’ve Been, which was acquired by TripAdvisor in 2011. I continue to champion the startup community and am passionate about bringing creative people together to solve today’s complex problems. </span></p>
<p><b>LTP: Give us a paragraph pitch of your company.</b></p>
<p><b>BW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapsheet is the pioneering provider of virtual claims technology used by auto insurance carriers to optimize workflows, speed up claims processes, and provide superior service to their customers. Our cloud-based software enables carriers to virtually process a claim with photos taken by the user via their smartphone. Through a multitude of technologies housed on our platform, we’re able to help insurance providers process claims quicker, allowing customers to be paid faster and back in safe, repaired vehicles sooner. </span></p>
<p><b>LTP: What problem are you solving today? </b></p>
<p><b>BW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re solving a variety of problems, as Snapsheet’s workflow improvements encompass all stages of the claims process. We help carriers and their claimants step-by-step through the entire claims journey – from first notice of loss and estimation, all the way to repair and payment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even now, the insurance industry relies heavily on legacy technology and manual processes. Nearly all claims payments are still paid by check, which can be a costly and burdensome experience. To solve this problem, Snapsheet came together with KeyBank to create </span><a href="https://www.snapsheettransactions.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapsheet Transactions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a solution that enables carriers to pay claimants virtually. </span></p>
<p><b>LTP: Who are you selling to?</b></p>
<p><b>BW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our customers are insurance carriers. Our role is to work closely with carriers, not disrupt the industry. Thanks to partnerships with carriers, we’re on track to process about 450,000 claims this year. With the launch of Snapsheet Transactions, we are able to expand our customer base beyond auto insurance.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP: Why did you start the company? </b></p>
<p><b>BW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating from Indiana University, I moved to L.A. to work as a production assistant for HBO. On my way to work one day, I got into a fender bender. I took my car to three different body shops and received three completely different estimates. Throughout this painful and long experience, I thought to myself, “There’s got to be an easier way.” I pooled all of my savings together and founded BodyShopBids, which later evolved into Snapsheet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move from BodyShopBids to Snapsheet happened in 2013. We determined that targeting consumers directly was not a sustainable business model. At the recommendation of a customer, we pivoted to working with insurance carriers. He introduced us to carriers who were very interested in the product, and we rebranded to Snapsheet. Although changing the direction of the company was challenging, there is no doubt that this was the right move for us.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP: What's the most important change coming to your segment in the next 3-5 years?</b></p>
<p><b>BW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a straight line between the expansion of the sharing economy and the rise of InsurTech. As the sharing economy is embraced by late adopters, there will be a massive shift in consumer expectations, and InsurTechs such as ours will be there to help insurance carriers adjust to these shifts.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP: What’s your next milestone?</b></p>
<p><b>BW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, we came together with KeyBank, one of the largest bank-based financial services companies in the United States, for the launch of Snapsheet Transactions. Together with KeyBank’s treasury knowledge and our insurance workflows expertise, we provide the technology needed to simplify claims and offer the optimal customer experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a significant need for digital payments. Looking at natural disasters like Hurricane Harvey, the importance of digital payments is more apparent than ever. After a hurricane, or any disaster for that matter, people can’t wait to receive a check in the mail. Snapsheet Transactions solves that problem for carriers and claimants.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP: What's one thing you wish customers knew before a sales meeting? </b></p>
<p><b>BW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wish customers knew how essential a good understanding of insurance workflows is, which other InsurTech companies don’t always have. Because we have a strong foundation with carriers, implementing Snapsheet is easy and the onboarding process for new clients is seamless.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP: What keeps you awake at night?</b></p>
<p><b>BW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that there is a better way and many people are going through countless hoops and not getting the answers they need. There’s no reason for that with the technology Snapsheet has made available to carriers. We have helped solve a big problem and it is important that more people have access to our solution.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP: Anything else you want to say to our audience?</b></p>
<p><b>BW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our aim is to make the entire claims process simple for everyone, so we’re constantly looking for ways to meet customer expectations that are actionable for carriers. Creating Snapsheet Transactions is just one step towards creating a seamless process from start to finish.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP Team: Thank you, Brad!</b></p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The brave new world of global finance is getting braver. Real-time and near-real-time payments systems have changed the fabric of online commerce." - Patricia Pozuelo, Enterprise Technology Specialist, Intel</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Global Race for Real-Time Payments</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">30+ countries have real-time payment processes of some kind (for example, Faster Payments in the UK, Singapore’s FAST); several have been in use for decades. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The reasons the US lags in development of its own RTP system: 1. The sheer number of financial institutions in the country compared to the rest of the world – the US has roughly 5,300 commercial banks and more than 6,000 credit unions; 2. Complicated regulations process; 3. The US’ complex regulatory process – 50 regulators + more than 20 federal agencies that all need to provide approval in order to implement RTP restructuring. The UK has one single agency.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The majority of Europe is already onboard with these streamlining banking upgrades as well, with countries like Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, and the Netherlands putting RTP services into practice nationally.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The Swiss National Bank has been ahead of the curve since 1987 when it introduced its 24-hour payment-processing SIC system and revolutionized the world of pre-internet banking.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">China’s mobile and digital payment market was the largest in the world at $1.83 trillion in 2016. Most of that activity comes from two companies: Alipay and Tenpay.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Japan has had their Zengin System running near-RTP for years, which is about to get an upgrade. SBI Ripple Asia recently announced the creation of a consortium of 42 member banks that will use Ripple’s new round-the-clock blockchain technology for payments and settlement.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The rest of the industrialized world has already implemented or started implementing fast-payment systems, including Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, India, and Australia.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">US P2P payments users are expected to grow to 126 million by 2020, with non-banks leading much of the charge. WEF estimates that 80% of banks are currently developing blockchain projects. About 19 of the biggest financial firms in the US all signed on for a new P2P payments network Zelle. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">FIS and The Clearing House also launched a nationwide RTP system during the first quarter of 2017, which could garner up to $1.1 billion in revenues. Both banks are also members of the Federal Reserve’s Faster Payments Task Force Steering Committee, which will soon start evaluating new approaches for implementing RTP across the country.</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley Undercuts Rivals With Robo</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has launched its online platform, Access Investing, with an annual fee below those of its wirehouse rivals. The program fee: 0.35% of assets under management per year. The robo portfolios include mutual funds and ETFs with both active and passive strategies. They also feature automated rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting at no additional charge.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Merrill Edge Guided Investing robo-service charges 0.45%, and Wells Fargo’s Intuitive Investor offering has a 0.50% fee. Discount brokerages Schwab, Fidelity and Vanguard all charge less than Morgan Stanley for advisor-focused robo services: 0.28% for Schwab Intelligent Advisor, 0.30% for Vanguard Personal Advisor Services, and 0.15% for Fidelity AMP. These fees don't include expenses on the underlying funds. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">While Morgan Stanley’s has a $5,000 account minimum, the competing Wells Fargo service can be accessed with $10,000 or more of client assets.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Morgan Stanley Access Investing is an opportunity for financial advisors to grow their book of business by making connections with prospects earlier and eventually establishing full-service relationships when clients are ready.” - Naureen Hassan, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley's Chief Digital Officer.</span></span></li>
