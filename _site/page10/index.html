          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term ‘credit’ means different things to different people. In a developed economy, it’s about measuring the value of one’s availability to receive goods and services based on the expectation that they will be paid back. A credit score is as important as a social security number, driver’s license or passport in establishing identity and offering opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet for the majority of people around the world, the idea of credit is just that – an idea. The lack of access to formal financial services – or any kind of financial identity – makes building a credit profile impossible. People in these cash-based societies are limited not just in acquiring financing to provide opportunity and relief, but they are often hampered in accessing their own cash during off-hours when stores or banks are closed, in remote locations, or during times of crises such as natural disasters.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Financial Identity Matters</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The modern lifestyle demands accessibility to funding that is often beyond our current means. Think for a moment of what your life would be like with no access to credit. Chances are you wouldn’t own a home or a car. Most of us could not have afforded our college education. The entrepreneurs among us would be hard-pressed to build successful businesses. And what about the ways we take advantage of credit cards – basically small-time loans that exist to allow us to pay for emergencies and unexpected expenses? Our financial identity is tied up in our access to these credit opportunities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The developing world has little to no access to these resources, largely because they have no financial identity. This is an environment where less than </span><a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialinclusion/overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">half of adults and small businesses own a bank account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and only one in ten people have access to credit. Yet it could be argued that a financial identity in these societies is even more vital, as the average person is informally employed and income can vary from day to day, week to week, or month to month. As is so often the case, those who need it most have the least amount of opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news, however, is that mobile devices – along with the existence of the cloud – are providing an entirely new landscape for the developing world. This landscape involves assigning a financial identity to those who have largely remained anonymous, reaching these populations through their smartphones. There are scores of creditworthy people on the planet, and </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/data-driven-mobile-financial-services-hold-key-to-unlocking-70-bn-dollars-telcos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we’ve proven before through data science</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that worthiness has little to do with income or wealth, but instead with the opportunity to demonstrate responsibility.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication as a Commodity: A Microcosm of How Credit Provides Value</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take for example a recent discovery by our data scientists at Juvo. These scientists have access to the communication habits of millions of people scattered all around the world, and as they analyzed the ways individuals reach out to one another, an interesting pattern emerged. People, regardless of location, culture, background – and yes, even wealth – value communication equally. In a comparison of countries with GDPs that range as much as 1000%, individuals spent roughly the same percentage of their income on communication and data.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Analysis of communication patterns around the world</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28584" src="/uploads/2017/12/ju1.png" alt="Why Mobile Credit Can Be the Entry Ticket to Financial Inclusion" width="1024" height="630" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So knowing communication and access to the outside world is a high priority regardless of income, we were curious how this commodity would be treated when resources are scarce, such as during a natural disaster. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When natural disasters strike in cash-based societies, one of the first things to happen is a run on cash. Stores, ATMs, and banks run out of money, and individuals are left without access to vital resources. Communication has proven to be as necessary a commodity as food or water in times of crises, and populations with access to some form of credit are able to take advantage of opportunities even when cash is scarce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this understanding in mind, we reviewed activity in the wake of recent hurricanes that rocked the Caribbean and observed a spike in prepaid mobile users topping up their phone allowances via on-demand credit extensions prior to hurricanes making landfall.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Credit-to-Cash Ratio just prior to Hurricanes Irma and Maria </b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28585" src="/uploads/2017/12/ju2.png" alt="Why Mobile Credit Can Be the Entry Ticket to Financial Inclusion" width="720" height="404" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What's even more striking is what takes place when the eye of the storm actually reach landfall. The following image shows the ratio of airtime credit extensions to cash top-ups as the eye of Hurricane Irma hit the Leeward Islands as well as Turks &amp; Caicos.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Credit-to-Cash Ratio during Hurricane Irma Landfall</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28586" src="/uploads/2017/12/ju3.png" alt="Why Mobile Credit Can Be the Entry Ticket to Financial Inclusion" width="1072" height="633" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As Irma made landfall, purchasing airtime from shops become extremely difficult, if not impossible. The graph above shows what happens when cash based-top ups are not possible. When traditional outlets were no longer available, users in these markets turned to their smartphones and their mobile financial identity to top-up and remain connected through and after the disaster. Many of these users had established a financial identity which enabled them to progress to borrowing a month of airtime credit during the hurricane for both voice and data use. Without this access, these users would have had to go without communication during the most intense moments of the storm – and after. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability of previously anonymous, prepaid users to take advantage of financial services and resources via their smartphone is particularly compelling when resources are otherwise unavailable. In many developing parts of the world, it isn’t just a natural disaster that limits access. Geographic and time constraints contribute, as does the availability of work, family issues, one’s health or any myriad of reasons that prevent the instant availability of necessary cash and accompanying resources.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Relationship Between Identity, Credit and Financial Inclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For these reasons, creating a mobile financial identity in order to provide mobile credit remains the best place to start to address financial exclusion in many parts of the world and smartphones are the most logical vehicle for providing it. Nearly 80% of people all across the globe have prepaid phones, and there are nearly $1 trillion in transactions taking place every day. This equates to a huge opportunity to meet people where they are, at the moment they need it, with real opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ways in which smartphones are reaching into every corner of the globe is truly transformative. It is incredibly exciting to be involved in the convergence of FinTech and mobile, and watch how these two industries will provide substantial opportunities to people around the world. Identity opens doors. It helps people access financial opportunities they wouldn’t otherwise have. It provides a means to necessary resources across disparate location, time and circumstance and provides a clear pathway toward greater financial access and inclusion. Building a financial identity is as vital to the emerging economy as it is to well-established ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a unique moment in time – something that could not have happened even five years ago. New populations of people are providing real benefit to mobile operators and financial services alike. The ubiquity of the cloud, along with smartphones, is driving emerging credit opportunities across the globe. In turn, those opportunities are driving financial inclusion.</span></p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robots are coming. But don’t worry – they’re here to help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next few years, chatbots will take on a bigger role within the remittance industry. Reports on the overall chatbot market show an expected compound annual growth rate of</span><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170728005739/en/Chatbots-Market-Reach-3.1-Billion-2021-Analysis"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">35.2%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 2016 to 2021 – eventually topping $3 billion. However, if done right, the opportunity within remittances could be much more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wondering what all the fuss is about? From </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/chatbots-will-enable-deeper-engagement-and-build-stronger-customer-loyalty/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transforming the user experience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to improving fraud detection, to delivering new levels of customer service, chatbots are primed to bring significant improvements to the world of money transfer.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ditching the form – a new user experience</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no doubt that </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/future-of-financial-services-mobile-and-instant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mobile devices are revolutionizing the way we make payments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Instead of relying on in-person interactions, customers are more likely to opt for the convenience of mobile. In the US alone, mobile payments volume will</span><a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/US+Mobile+Payments+Will+More+Than+Triple+By+2021/-/E-RES132017"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">more than triple by 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For remittances, chatbots can similarly transform the tedious data collection process. Mobile devices enable consumers to make payments anytime, anywhere </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but the experience can still leave much to be desired. Never-ending forms and interfaces that aren’t optimized for mobile have the potential to alienate consumers who want a faster way to submit payment information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With chatbots, that issue may become a thing of the past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through a series of questions to collect and confirm important details, chatbots can create a money transfer experience that is both simple and convenient. This should speed up the process, improve the quality of information provided, and tailor the set of questions to the minimum information needed from that customer for that transfer. Moreover, a chatbot experience has the potential to capture customer attention and increase referrals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using a chatbot that efficiently collects payment information, the stage is set for a more enjoyable experience that will keep customers coming back more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud mitigation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud is one of the top concerns for any mobile payments company. Efforts by remittance companies to stop fraudsters often clutter the customer’s experience and slow the settlement process. </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/how-banks-regulators-are-applying-machine-learning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning is the wave of the present for fighting fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both because of its effectiveness and the user experience it enables. However, this behind-the-scenes magic is dependent on a key factor - data inputs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a chatbot, remittance companies will have access to data rarely present in the payment industry, including language, spelling, punctuation, and response time. Each of these data points can be used as data inputs for a remittance company’s machine learning fraud prevention engine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased engagement through chatbots will create a stronger digital fingerprint for new customers and help remittance companies streamline the experience for loyal customers. Better yet, remittance companies will lower costs by making it harder for bad guys to game the system - creating a competitive advantage and savings that can be passed along to the customer.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real-time customer service</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most consumers, one element of the payment experience rises above the rest – speed. Nearly</span><a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/16-03-03-your_customers_dont_want_to_call_you_for_support/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">three out of four consumers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> say that valuing their time is the most important thing a company can do to provide them with good customer service. Chatbots make it even easier to be available to customers when they need help without sacrificing their overall experience.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps most importantly, chatbots help transfer control back to the consumer. It is not uncommon for questions to pop up during the remittance process. Chatbots can ensure real-time answers. Rather than picking up the phone or meeting with a customer service representative in person, consumers can immediately get the help they need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though chatbots may not yet offer the same personal touch as an in-person interaction, the speed, and convenience of the experience isn’t too far off. In each case, the results remain the same – real-time answers at a moment’s notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shift from an in-person to chatbot-enabled remittance experience isn’t too concerning for most people. In fact,</span><a href="https://research.hubspot.com/reports/artificial-intelligence-is-here"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">40 percent of consumers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> don’t care whether a chatbot or a person answers their customer service questions. Rather than focusing on the way in which answers are delivered, consumers are much more enamored with getting in, getting out and getting on their way.</span></p>
<h2><b>A chatbot-enabled future</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past few decades, technology has propelled the payments industry forward. With the rise of the internet and mobile devices, global remittances are taking place more than ever before. And with that, chatbots are reintroducing the ability to ask questions – and get answers – at a moment’s notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to remittances, the benefits of chatbots are twofold. Not only can consumers continue to enjoy the convenience of digitally fueled money transfers, but they also have the opportunity to calm any fraud- or service-related concerns before going ahead with a transaction. Taking a chance on chatbot technology opens the door to delivering a payment experience marked by increased control, security, and convenience. </span></p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual real estate is the perfect storm in the making, and blockchain technology may become its driving force in the 2018 and beyond. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Blockchain Is Breathing New Life Into Virtual Real Estate</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">VR is projected to become a $40 billion industry by 2020.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s modern VR platforms leverage emerging technologies such as blockchain to make virtual property ownership and trade more secure. Virtual reality platform </span><a href="https://decentraland.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentraland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, uses blockchain to identify and designate ownership of land in its virtual world.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Because of the various possible applications of VR, virtual real estate can function similarly to real-world properties that they can be sold, leased, and used for virtual activities. Blockchain could help formalize the market for these virtual properties.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">New VR technologies are bringing a resurgence of interest in virtual worlds. Improved headsets now showcase high-resolution display panels that allow for better visuals. Hardware such as tactile gloves can now also offer finer controls and haptic feedback creating more immersive experiences for users.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">As an investment opportunity, virtual real estate offers rewards comparable to real-world properties. High traffic areas in virtual worlds are prime locations for commercial use and brand visibility. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Modern VR platforms can even allow for a variety of campaigns that maximize the sensory capabilities of the new hardware. Businesses could create showrooms where customers can see products in 3D and even “feel” them. The perfect storm is brewing for VR. The improvements in the VR hardware are allowing for richer experiences. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Beyond gaming and virtual exploration, developers on decentralized platforms could even look into creating virtual venues for events such as concerts, shows, and sports. Similar to real-world events, marketers can use these to push brands and even virtual merchandise.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/omribarzilay/2017/11/30/how-blockchain-is-breathing-new-life-into-virtual-real-estate/#70285399511e"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto-updates </span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coinbase must share users' cryptocurrency data with the IRS</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Coinbase will be forced to share the financial information of 14,355 users with the IRS, following a California federal court ruling. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The data sharing affects every user who has bought, sold, sent or received more than $20,000 through their accounts in a single year between 2013 and 2015. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The company will have to turn over the user's name, date of birth, address, and taxpayer ID, plus records of all account activity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Coinbase has some six million users, but fewer than 1,000 have officially declared cryptocurrency activity.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next stop in the cryptocurrency craze: A government-backed coin</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Central banks around the world are busy experimenting with their own versions of cryptocurrency. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">China's central bank announced in January that it has completed a successful trial run of transacting digital currencies among banks. In September, Japan, Sweden, and Estonia all announced similar digital currency projects: J-coin for Japan, E-krona for Sweden and Estcoin for Estonia. The UK, Uruguay, and Kazakhstan have all expressed similar ambitions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">"The [Chinese government thinks] that [cryptocurrencies] could potentially threaten the central government control over the financial system." – Paul Triolo, Practice Head of Geotechnology at Eurasia Group. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">William Dudley, President &amp; CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said the Fed is exploring the idea of offering its own digital currency. "To me, the idea of cryptocurrency is free of control from any person and institution. There's nothing cryptocurrency about these [government-backed projects]," said Jacob Eliosoff, investment manager of Trevi Digital Assets Fund.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The market of cryptocurrencies is expected to reach $2 trillion in 2018.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Rod Garratt, an economics professor at UCSB (University of California, Santa Barbara), thinks "if there was a central bank cryptocurrency that provides some anonymity, then it would be a very close substitute for Bitcoin, except it would not provide autonomy. So it really comes down to what feature people desire."</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">"Central banks don't get to decide whether or not Bitcoin is there or not; Bitcoin is there," said Garratt.</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech updates</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why PayPal Is Teaming Up with Acorns</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">PayPal recently announced the integration of its platform with Acorns Grow, a mobile app that provides automated savings and investment services that mainly target millennials. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The integration will allow PayPal users to link their accounts with the Acorns app to be able to automatically save and invest through the Acorns app whenever they make a purchase using PayPal. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Acorns provides robo-advisor services. Subscribers link their debit/credit cards or digital wallets to the Acorns app and whenever they make a purchase, the app rounds up their spending to the nearest dollar and then invests the change. Acorns charges $1.00 a month to manage the investment portfolios of its subscribers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Robo-advisors such as Acorns and Betterment are expected to have $385 billion worth of assets under investment by 2021. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">PayPal closed 3Q17 with 218 million active customer accounts with the vast majority of the accounts belonging to consumers. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">For PayPal, the tie-up with Acorns fits the ambition to offer a broader range of financial services as it seeks to diversify its revenue streams. Additionally, the integration with Acorns could help PayPal attract more users, especially those left out of the mainstream investment services because of high fees or other barriers.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want a loan? Make sure you’re tweeting the right things</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The article that someone tweeted about, posts that they liked on Facebook, and a new phone just bought on an e-commerce site – all these events now play a crucial role in determining if an individual is eligible for a loan or not.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">In India's online lending ecosystem, firms are heavily relying on unconventional data to assess a consumer’s loan eligibility. New-age firms are moving away from traditional methods to judge repayment capacities and, based on their own algorithms, are coming up with dynamic credit scores to effectively assess a customer’s creditworthiness.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The 166 million households that make up middle-income India – with annual earnings of between $3,414 to $5,572 – typically apply for personal loans to buy consumer durables, for weddings, to meet medical expenses, set up a new business, and the likes. These consumers are a potential goldmine for online lending firms because they include many first-time borrowers who may struggle to understand the exhaustive paperwork and procedures to secure a loan from traditional banks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“As a consumer, our needs are evolving and we need scenarios where there is a faster turnaround time. By using AI and algorithms, we can drastically reduce the time taken to approve a loan request, compared to the traditional lenders.” – Manav Jeet, CEO of Rubique. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">FinTech players can decide to lend within a few minutes by using algorithms that can collect supporting personal, professional, and financial details of potential borrowers. The list of items assessed can include social media profiles, friends on social media, payment history for telecom bills (for postpaid customers), geographical locations, online shopping history, devices used for surfing, lifestyle details, the internet usage timings, consumption patterns, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“We have about 80-90 parameters that are used to check a consumer’s creditworthiness. And that’s where technology comes into play to ensure that it can be done swiftly and efficiently." – Satyam Kumar, Co-founder, LoanTap. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">In certain cases, relying on alternate data to determine creditworthiness may be a better way than how banks go about it.</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IoT world</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hottest IoT applications for 2018</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">IoT is going to expand on its current strengths in the coming year, broadening its presence in the industrial, energy and transportation sectors and continuing to see growing usage in fields like healthcare and retail.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“Newer use cases and deployment across the distributed enterprise, retail and logistics, healthcare and smart cities will provide increased momentum across these verticals.” – Rohit Mehra, IDC Vice President for network infrastructure research. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">One common theme for new IoT deployments in 2018 involves the coordination of high-value infrastructure that occupies relatively large geographical areas. – Northeastern University Silicon Valley campus IoT program director Kilton Hopkins</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“Many verticals still have business operations that involve manual observation of equipment status, inventory levels, and other key metrics,” he said. “Where there is currently manual observation, there may be a great opportunity for a high-ROI project involving IoT. Some verticals that have a lot of manual observations are oil and gas, energy distribution, supply chain, and telecommunications.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Large-scale management application is becoming more attractive in part because the technology around IoT is advancing quickly. – Northeastern University Silicon Valley dean P.K. Agarwal. “Device management and connectivity management has been around for several years already, but now that the pieces of IoT systems are coming together to form whole enterprise-scale solutions, management of these solutions has become higher up on the ‘tech wish list’ for organizations.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“The hype around and growing adoption of intelligent agents like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant in more and more devices will open marketers’ eyes to new ways of interacting with customers more than any other recent technology has — including wearables.” </span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interesting reads on Amazon</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Consumer Brands Can Succeed In An Amazon World</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon was quick to prioritize serving its most loyal customer base with a fast mobile app that makes for an enjoyable shopping experience, catering to the modern-day, ‘on-the-go’ consumer. The app receives over 75,000 downloads a day in the United States alone. With mobile-optimized features such as predictive and voice search, a customer can quickly narrow their search for a product and filter through Amazon’s extensive catalog. Users can also specify faster delivery preferences by activating the “Prime” feature, and then within a couple of clicks, seamlessly checkout. Amazon has also created success with its “Prime Day” shopping holiday. Similar to Black Friday, Prime Day encourages more spending on Amazon with exclusive discounts and offers and fast shipping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By prioritizing the user experience, including, fast search, simple and often free returns, frictionless payments, and creating events that drive a sense of urgency from an already loyal customer base, the e-commerce giant has created an exemplary business model to envy and one that brands should borrow from and emulate as they prepare for 2018.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competition in the AI Cloud Is Heating Up, and Amazon Just Made a Big Move</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The cloud is no longer just a data dump—it’s an AI battleground, and Amazon wants to beat all comers into submission.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">At an event in Las Vegas, Amazon announced a raft of new AI services that it hopes will allow it to stave off competition and maintain its cloud lead.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Chief among the new offerings is a series of off-the-shelf AI software packages that users can run on Amazon’s servers: 1) Transcribe, which converts speech in audio files into clean, time-stamped, punctuated text; 2) Translate uses deep learning to shift texts between seven languages. Comprehend can detect sentiment in text; 3) Rekognition can detect and track people, activities, and objects in video; 4) The firm has also launched an AI development platform called SageMaker, which is designed to make it easier for developers to build and train their own neural networks and run them on petabyte-scale data sets. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The idea is to make it easy for newbie developers to embrace AI on Amazon’s cloud.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">There’s also a new deep-learning-enabled programmable video camera, called DeepLens, that is powerful enough to run its own AI algorithms and seems to be intended as a gateway for developers keen to understand what AI can do when combined with hardware.</span></li>
