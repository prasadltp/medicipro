              <p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/22-companies-leveraging-blockchain-for-identity-management-and-authentication/">Identity management</a>, which encapsulates the issues of security and <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/privacy-is-not-personal-rather-a-community-concern/">privacy</a>, will be one of the most critical factors to ensure that secure m-transactions can successfully scale. Security of an individual’s data will have to become the responsibility of a trusted community, where the risk and rewards of accessing an individual’s data are stacked up for the consumer rather than against. Effectively, the issue of security will dovetail into the larger issue of privacy, and the key will be to find the right balance between disclosure and oversight.</p>

              <p>International tourists spent close to <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.TVLX.CD">$1.4 trillion</a> during their cross-border adventures in 2015. Since international tourism is one of the largest sources of income for a significant number of destinations around the world – in developing countries and developed ones – the banking industry has had to evolve their instruments to ensure that costs associated with international payments are democratized enough, and, at the same time, leverage the opportunity to profitably prime the traveling population to incur significant expenses.</p>

According to the latest report from FT Partners, banking (including P2P lending), and payments scored the most deals in the period. With innovation in facilitating convenient banking services, comes ever-accelerating fraud risk and a considerate cost at which security breaches come to companies. No wonder forward-thinking teams continue to secure financial support for advanced security solutions, and payments behemoths continue an aggressive push to make payments convenient.</p>
