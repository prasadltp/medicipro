                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>The development of <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/by-2020-the-consumer-market-for-mobile-biometrics-will-exceed-34-6-billion/">biometrics on mobile devices</a> is set to have an outsized impact on mobile wallets and international money transfer. Advances such as fingerprint login, retinal scan, and facial recognition offer a rare opportunity for remittance companies to both combat fraud and improve the user experience.</p>

<p>Mobile wallet transactions alone are expected to reach nearly <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/mobile-wallet-spend-to-rise-by-more-than-30-this">$1.4 trillion</a> in 2017, growing 32% compared to 2016, and the number of mobile phone users will top 5 billion. Biometrics represents the next major technological advance that will push FinTech past traditional banks.</p>

<p>With the current mobile focus of the remittance industry, it is uniquely positioned to not only ensure money arrives but also to know the identity of every customer – at scale and without a retail footprint. One of the most critical parts of enabling and safeguarding money transfers requires knowing a user’s identity — and biometrics offers a way to do just that.</p>

<h2 id="entering-the-next-phase-of-fintech">Entering the next phase of FinTech</h2>

<p>The internet was the original game changer, enabling digitally funded remittances for the first time. Then, the advent of smartphones pushed the industry into a new phase by simplifying the experience and empowering the customer to send money from anywhere. Now, the advanced biometrics offered on mobile devices ushers in a new era.</p>

<p>Biometrics improves the user experience by reducing form fields, eliminating the need to upload a picture of a physical ID, and fully automating the know-your-customer (KYC)/anti-fraud process. Moreover, for the first time, digitally funded transfers will offer better KYC and fraud checks than banks or brick-and-mortar competitors.</p>

<p>Today, capturing an image of a photo ID is the ultimate method of KYC. If a company has your ID, they know who you are – or so we are told.</p>

<p>In the future, easy-to-fake physical IDs will not be sufficient, as the standard is pushed to fingerprints, retinal scans or face recognition.</p>

<p>In other words, the mobile connection to users will be more valuable than an in person, retail experience.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-vulnerabilities">Understanding the vulnerabilities</h2>

<p>The authentication of identities and information – especially in financial transactions – is far from a new concept. However, traditional methods will not be able to keep up with the rapidly changing technology landscape.</p>

<p>With hacked or compromised credentials, attackers can wreak havoc by posing as legitimate users and moving or stealing unauthorized funds. Not only is there a risk of theft, but fraudsters also exploit peer-to-peer (P2P) money transfer services for money laundering and terrorism financing. Considering the fact that P2P payments are expected to be used by nearly<a href="https://www.javelinstrategy.com/press-release/javelin-predicts-1-2-us-consumers-will-conduct-p2p-2021"> 129 million adults</a> in the US by 2021, the threat isn’t going away anytime soon.</p>

<p>Combating cybercrime in such a highly regulated industry requires authenticating users and truly knowing a person is who they say they are. In addition to KYC, it’s also crucial to leverage technological advancements to stay one step ahead of fraudsters and their accelerating threats.</p>

<h2 id="international-impact">International impact</h2>

<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/behaviometrics-will-define-the-new-era-of-security/">Advances in biometrics</a> will have a disproportionately positive impact on people from developing countries where the current ID technology is low and less reliable.</p>

<p>The number of people living outside of the country in which they were born has surpassed<a href="http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates15.shtml"> 244 million</a>, representing a 41% increase between 2000 and 2015. Many of these people come from places where the identity infrastructure is weak and disconnected from developed systems in the US and Europe.</p>

<p>However, with biometrics, remittance companies will no longer need to accommodate a driver’s license from India or voting card from Mexico. Instead, they can use biometrics to safely and securely identify customers across the world.</p>

<h2 id="new-challenges-in-fraud-in-money-laundering">New challenges in fraud in money laundering</h2>

<p>Of course, for every technological advance in combating fraud and money laundering, there is a response from resourceful criminals across the world. Even with biometrics, money launderers will attempt synthetic biometrics or general hacking.</p>

<p>Still, with legacy players lagging behind and focused on traditional methods of fraud prevention, advances by FinTechs will make them the less desirable adversary and push much of the challenges to the less equipped competitors.</p>

<h2 id="do-customers-actually-want-this">Do customers actually want this?</h2>

<p>Technological advances are great, but only valuable if customers buy in. People are growing accustomed to mobile biometrics – from unlocking their devices with the touch of a finger to using facial or voice recognition to make purchases.</p>

<p>Not only are users comfortable with this type of authentication, they prefer it. About <a href="https://newsroom.mastercard.com/news-briefs/overcoming-mobile-biometric-challenges-mastercard-and-university-of-oxford-collaborate-on-new-research-initiative/">93%</a> of consumers would rather use biometrics than passwords. This represents a mindset shift to methods that are based on who a person is, not what information they can remember.</p>

<p>Implementing biometrics as a security measure also helps to build trust with users, especially since more than three-quarters (78%) of customers believe a mobile app with biometrics is more secure compared to apps without it. With that trust, comes the opportunity to drive increased brand loyalty and better user experience.</p>

<p>There are many innovations on the road ahead, but few stand to impact remittances – and FinTech as a whole – like biometrics. With more users, the continued proliferation of mobile devices and the relentless threat of cybercrime, FinTechs are poised to push past banks as the preferred and most trusted custodians of consumer funds.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>With software evolution comes the hardware revision. As advanced AI requires new levels of computational capabilities, the very hardware that fuels it is being redesigned to allow emerging industries and technologies to fast-track development and adoption.</p>

<h2 id="pick-1-the-ai-chip-startup-explosion-is-already-here">Pick #1. The AI chip startup explosion is already here</h2>

<p>When you talk to investors in Silicon Valley, you’ll still find some skepticism. Why, for example, would companies look to buy faster chips for their training when older cards in an Amazon server may be just as good for their training? And yet there is still an enormous amount of money flowing into this area. And it’s coming from firms that are the same ones that bet big on Uber (though there’s quite a bit of turbulence there) and WhatsApp.</p>

<p>Nvidia is still a clear leader in this area and will look to continue its dominance as devices like autonomous cars become more and more relevant. But as we go into 2018, we’ll most likely start to get a better sense as to whether these startups actually have an opportunity to unseat Nvidia. There’s the tantalizing opportunity of creating faster, lower-power chips that can go into internet-of-things thingies and truly fulfill the promise of those devices with more efficient inference. And there’s the opportunity of making those servers faster and more power-efficient when they look to train models – like ones that tell your car what a squirrel looks like – may also turn out to be something truly massive.</p>

<h2 id="pick-2-quantum-computers-barely-exist--heres-why-were-writing-languages-for-them-anyway">Pick #2. Quantum Computers Barely Exist – Here’s Why We’re Writing Languages for Them Anyway</h2>

<p>Programming languages for classical computers are designed in a way that doesn’t require developers to know how a central processing unit works. The push now is to create high-level quantum programming languages that also shield developers from the complexities of quantum hardware.</p>

<p>The quirks of quantum computing create limitations that don’t exist in classical programming languages. One example: quantum programs can’t have loops in them that repeat a sequence of instructions; they have to run straight through to completion.</p>

                <title>The Big Question for Insurers Is Not Tech but Whom to Partner With for IOT InsurTech</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/2017/12/25/the-big-question-for-insurers-is-not-tech-but-whom-to-partner-with-for-iot-insurtech/</link>
                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>I would start with a quote by Edewede Oriwoh: “The <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/internet-of-things-iot-evolution/">Internet of Things</a> is not a concept; it is a network, the true technology-enabled Network of all networks.” I truly believe that this is just the beginning we are witnessing. As per Gartner, 20.4 billion connected “things” will be in use by 2020 with consumer segment having the largest number of users (60% of the market). The IoT endpoint spending worldwide is expected to be over $2.9 trillion. The cross-industry devices, such as those targeted at smart buildings (including LED lighting, HVAC, and physical security systems) will be in demand as connectivity is driven into higher-volume, lower-cost devices.</p>

<p>With the insurance industry trying hard to navigate what I believe to be a sinking ship, the IoT seems to present a ray of hope. IoT has enabled the evolution of core business models, centered on need servicing, data-driven decision-making, and predictive advisory. Traditionally, business models revolved around product provisioning and one-time sales. The IoT has presented an opportunity for cross-sale/up-sale, thus identifying new sources of revenue generation.</p>

<h2 id="insurance-pain-points">Insurance Pain Points</h2>

<p>Currently, the insurance industry is plagued by a one-size-fits-all policy (think of current health, life insurance, and auto insurance you avail) instead of a target-based policy (what we have experienced in lending, and other FinTech verticals). Customer loyalty/experience was always and still is a sorry state in most insurance companies. Policy renewal, after-sales service for claims, etc., ranks low on the priority list. The touchpoints with customer occur only once or twice per year unless you get into trouble. (I’ve experienced this myself over the last seven years). Additionally, the antique data points (with no relation to risk prevention and monitoring) are being used for pricing and risk management. Due to limited data availability, insurance fraud often drags the financial performance of companies.</p>

<h2 id="iot--a-ray-of-hope">IoT – A ray of hope</h2>

<p>“In God We Trust. All Others Must Bring Data.” – W. Edwards Deming, Statistician, professor &amp; author</p>

<p>IoT is a network of physical objects that gathers as well as transmits information for data processing and insights. The collected data allows better decision-making in pricing, risk assessment, etc., for insurance companies. P&amp;C lines were the first to adopt this through auto telematics. Recently, we have seen interest in other lines of insurance business such as health, home, industries, etc. Demands for drones for property inspection, usage-based insurance, sensors, and detectors are increasing particularly in commercial insurance (factories, warehouses, commercial vehicles, etc.).</p>

<p>The IoT will enable companies to shift their strategy from reactive restitution to proactive prevention. For example: <a href="https://www.gemalto.com/iot">Gemalto’s IoT solution</a> enables remote monitoring of smart objects, thus eliminating middlemen. Smart Structures embeds sensors in its structure during concrete pouring, thus enabling the real-time health monitoring of its buildings.</p>

<h2 id="five-key-areas-for-iot-value-addition-for-the-insurance-ecosystem">Five key areas for IoT value addition for the insurance ecosystem:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Increasing the number of touchpoints: Traditionally, insurers interact with their customers only once or twice a year – for policy renewal or claims. IoT offers an opportunity to initiate a continuous, end-to-end dialogue, leading ultimately to a new personalized relationship. Example: Accenture has developed a connected home platform that connects the most relevant devices to homeowners and insurers, including cameras, window and door sensors, motion detectors, etc. It allows insurers’ CRM systems to monitor usage and trigger discounts as appropriate based on data, enhancing customer experience.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Product innovation: Startups are building new products such as usage-based insurance, short-term insurance, lifestyle products, etc. This enables low-risk customers to get customized products and be awarded for “good behavior.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fraud prevention and claims management: With novel data, companies can use analytics to weed out frauds and bogus claims. Wearables are enhancing fraud detection capabilities. As reported in the <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/magazines/features/2017/02/20/441830.htm">Insurance Journal</a>, there was a case where a heart monitor’s data was used to prove an individual may have been involved in arson. According to the report, data recorded by a man’s cardiac pacemaker helped lead to his indictment on charges of aggravated arson and insurance fraud in a fire at his Ohio home.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Risk management: Having continuous real-time data enables companies to assess risks better, which in turn helps in pricing and underwriting to be more dynamic and personalized.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enhanced customer base: An opportunity to reach more tech-savvy customers who are underinsured or do not want to take up insurance.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="whats-next-for-the-insurance-ecosystem">What’s next for the insurance ecosystem</h2>

<p>Although there is a proliferation in <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/research-categories/fintech-foresights-vol-2">connected devices</a> (owing to the decreasing cost of hardware/software, enhanced data storage and processing frameworks, smartphone penetration, etc.), insurers have failed or are finding it hard to convince customers about the benefits. The challenge lies in scaling and the mass adoption of IoT-based insurance products. This is the only way it can have a meaningful impact on their profitability.</p>

<p>Although the key is to form partnerships in the industry’s ecosystem (IoT value chain), the question that remains is this: how do they move forward? There are many questions which insurers need to find the answers for. Will insurers tie up with multiple stakeholders in the value chain? Will it increase the complexity? The other option is to tie up with big industry players (like Accenture) to get a full-stack solution. But this reduces the flexibility and might impact the cost centers of the insurers.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/IO1.png" alt="IO1.png" /></p>

<p>There is another option – to partner with InsurTech startups (see below infographic), work with manufacturers, and build connections directly into the product. This helps in tapping into the expertise of IoT startups and quickly launching the product into the market. More information about IoT startups and partnerships can be found in the <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/research-categories/disruptive-trends-in-insurtech-current-and-beyond">Disruptive Trends in InsurTech – Current and Beyond</a> report.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/IO2.png" alt="IO2.png" /></p>

<p>Additionally, they may seek to tie up with other large tech firms (Amazon – Echo, Microsoft- Cortana, etc.) and nudge consumers towards purchasing.</p>

<p>Consumers also have not helped the insurer’s cause as they do not feel comfortable volunteering their information. The huge amount of data from connected insurance has made regulatory bodies to mandate consumer data protection policies. With the Data Protection (GDPR) regulation in EU, the going may get tougher as it lets customers take more control of their data. Also, questions remain on how to build standards, guidelines around data sharing, and how these standards will differ globally. Insurers and other IoT players need to find a common ground.</p>

<p>Also, insurers need to jump the wave from risk transfer (currently) to risk monitoring and management. Only then will they will be to provide a real-time, risk-based insurance product.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-it-for-insurers">What’s in it for insurers?</h2>

<p>The IoT enables insurers to revamp/add products to their current operations of selling insurance to consumers. It provides an opportunity for increasing their customer base across verticals by offering a better risk-based product. Additionally, it lets them increase their profitability by eliminating fraudulent claims and improve their top line through the cross-selling of insurance products.</p>

                <title>Holiday 101: Recognizing Fraud &amp; How to Beat It</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/2017/12/22/holiday-101-recognizing-fraud-and-how-to-beat-it/</link>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>The holidays are a major stress test for professionals supporting the retail pipeline. Every year, e-commerce retailers (eTailers) vow to fight the wave of holiday fraud better than the year before without turning away good business. Now they must also prepare to defend themselves against more overall fraud attacks; they can expect <a href="https://www.aciworldwide.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2017/january/global-fraud-attempts-increased-by-31-during-holiday-shopping-season">fraud attempts</a> to jump by 30% or more – much like they did in 2016. One of the biggest challenges eTailers face is recognizing criminals hiding amongst the higher volume of shopping during peak season. Another key challenge is anticipating a fraudster’s tactics, which become increasingly sophisticated to fool businesses out of goods and services.</p>

<p>So, how should eTailers fight these and other fraud challenges before they are slammed with peak season? There are four key steps:</p>

<h2 id="1-think-like-a-criminal">1. Think like a criminal</h2>

<p>Have a fraud team member routinely challenge rules and make fine-tuning adjustments based on what he/she learns. Keep a line of communication open with the promotions department, so you’re aware of what deals fraudsters might attempt to take advantage of, like offer codes and other holiday-specific promotions.</p>

<p>Criminals attack their eTailer victims through several different channels including mobile web, call centers, retail stores, and online shopping. Savvy fraud teams employ a range of tools to fight these attacks including identity verification, device fingerprinting, IP proxy detection and geolocation, transaction and custom scoring, and order linking.</p>

<p>One of the strongest indicators of online fraud is the identity information of the consumer (or criminal). In fraudulent transactions, there’s a high likelihood of account credentials, identity information or credit cards having been purchased from the “dark web,” or the internet’s black market, where this information is freely sold. Rarely do criminals get a full account profile, so they often cobble together authentic credentials into a synthetic identity. Fortunately, with today’s identity verification tools, fraud teams can quickly flag indicators that a user might not be exactly who they say they claim to be.</p>

<p>Sometimes thinking like a criminal means thinking like a robot. Bot activity and automated fraud attacks are relatively new fraud attacks and are becoming more widely used. Malicious bot activity makes up 20% to 50% or more of traffic on e-commerce and media sites. During the holiday season when order volumes are at annual peaks, criminals attempt to blend in with the large number of transactions. There are a few <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/behavioral-biometrics-dynamic-approach-to-authentication-and-security/">biometric fraud detection solutions</a> that detect bot-like behavior and deter that type of fraud.</p>

<h2 id="2-thoughtfully-expand-your-efforts">2. Thoughtfully expand your efforts</h2>

<p>The rush of holiday traffic will undoubtedly mean a temporary, larger fraud operation. Acknowledging that your fraud review team cannot scale proportionately with the increase of volume, consider the best combination of software – using advanced techniques in <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/how-banks-regulators-are-applying-machine-learning/">machine learning</a> and <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/ai-most-defining-technology-banking-industry/">artificial intelligence</a> – and staff additions. When identifying the right solution, make sure the machine learning capabilities truly add value all year-long and can keep pace when traffic volumes multiply.</p>

<p>When you do expand your seasonal staff, conduct thorough fraud training – especially if they have a customer service background or mentality. Trained fraud professionals operate with a healthy dose of skepticism and take careful measures not to let a friendly voice fool them into an account takeover or another scheme. This is called “social engineering” and often, is a most-effective cross-channel fraud technique for criminals – get an online order rejected and call to complain to have that “reject” decision reversed.</p>

<h2 id="3-track-false-positives">3. Track false positives</h2>

<p>In today’s e-commerce world where there are quite literally millions of choices, losing a loyal customer is tragic. The lost lifetime value of that customer can be huge for a company. This holds especially true during the holidays. <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/during-the-holidays-existing-customers-are-more-valuable-than-new-ones/">One study</a> found that holiday business from repeat customers is greater for both the short term and the long term, and for repeat customers who came back at some point after the holiday season – they spent 160% more than new customers.</p>

<p>Why is the value of the customer so important to fraud? Because your propensity to reject a good customer can result in significant lost revenue. About 10% <a href="https://www.cybersource.com/content/dam/cybersource/2017_Fraud_Benchmark_Report.pdf">of rejected transactions</a> are estimated to be false positives. When any of those customers could have become a return customer, it’s worth taking a step back and to make sure you are not too risk-averse. Not all online retailers are tracking false positives, so this holiday season, make it a goal to track false positives and improve your systems to reduce them. Often eTailers have to call customers that were rejected in order to truly determine the level of their false positives. This is extremely valuable information and it’s not uncommon to win back customers that may have been lost forever by reaching out.</p>

<h2 id="4-leverage-identity-linkages">4. Leverage identity linkages</h2>

<p>In an age where data breaches are far too common – some estimate that the identity of nearly every American adult has been compromised – an online retailer’s confidence in approving or rejecting transactions hinges on the ability to verify identity. One of the simplest and fastest ways to do so involves identity data linkages, which is especially effective at determining a customer’s legitimacy and protecting against account takeover and synthetic identity fraud.</p>

<p>Identity linkages include confirming an applicant’s phone is linked to their name, an address to a name, and an email to a name. Additionally, signals like the date that email was first seen online are huge indicators of risk. Email first seen yesterday? That would be very risky. Retailers who link together identity elements won’t prevent a good customer from getting their holiday goods and will effectively deter fraud attacks.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Be prepared this holiday season: utilize a fully prepared fraud team and customer identity verification strategy. The perfect combination will deliver faster approvals for legitimate customers, reduce fraud and lower false positives this upcoming holiday season so you can concentrate on your bottom line.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>High connectivity is one of the hallmarks of the modern society. At any moment in time, individuals are plugged into society through the range of devices, which as well are constituting a complex ecosystem of smart connected things. According to <a href="http://harvardecon.org/?p=3310">HBR</a>, “Consumers are becoming more and more connected whether it is at home, at work, behind the wheel, when they engage in sports and leisure activities, and so on. This is happening quite fast, due to the adoption of smart devices, and companies have to be able to react accordingly in order to maximize value both for their clients and for themselves.”</p>

<p>Italy is known to be one of the leading nations when it comes to connected devices, and a homeland of telematics, which is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141007053518-6024099-health-insurance-telematics-opportunity">defined</a> by Matteo Carbone as an “integrated use of informatics and telecommunication, it is about capturing, storing and analyzing data via telecommunication devices. &lt;…&gt; Telematics could be one of the most relevant digital innovation in the insurance industry directly impacting the technical results. Due to the pervasive diffusion of the Internet of Everything this approach could be extended from motor insurance to other insurance businesses.”</p>

<p>In its latest development, Italy’s largest telecommunications provider Telecom Italia, is powering the country with a new wireless network for the IoT.</p>

<h2 id="pick-1-italy-launches-a-new-wireless-network-for-the-internet-of-things">Pick #1. Italy Launches a New Wireless Network for the Internet of Things</h2>

<p>Telecom Italia, Italy’s largest telecommunications provider, is putting the finishing touches on a new wireless network for the Internet of Things that should be available nationwide by the end of January.</p>

<p>Connected devices often don’t need as much bandwidth as smartphones, but connecting them through existing LTE networks is expensive. In order for the IoT to catch on, telecommunications companies believe those devices need their own dedicated wireless networks. Two new types of networks – called Long Term Evolution for Machines (LTE-M) and Narrowband–Internet of Things (NB-IoT) – are now being deployed for that purpose. Both are designed for low-power devices that send only a few bits of data at a time.</p>

<p>Unlike Wi-Fi, these networks operate in a licensed cellular spectrum where there is minimal radio interference. They also provide coverage over tens of kilometers, much farther than local wireless access points or short-range technologies such as Bluetooth and Zigbee.</p>

<h2 id="pick-2-ubs-eyes-wider-rollout-of-online-wealth-management-service">Pick #2. UBS eyes wider rollout of online wealth management service</h2>

<p>UBS, the world’s biggest private bank, is considering rolling out its online investment platform in more countries after a successful trial in Britain. SmartWealth, which launched in Britain this year, provides automated financial advice for customers looking to invest upward of £15,000.</p>

<p>“We built a fully automated digital wealth management adviser. Scaling this up will be essential,” the Swiss bank’s Chief Operating Officer for wealth management, Dirk Klee, told Reuters.</p>

<p>UBS hopes SmartWealth will help expand its customer base from millionaires and billionaires to the mass affluent, those with assets of 100,000-2 million pounds to invest. SmartWealth could be expanded on the back of the bank’s newly unified IT platform, which excludes only the bank’s US private banking business which is run out of a separate American division.</p>

<p>Last year, UBS said it would spend around 1 billion Swiss francs ($1 billion) to standardize its IT platform across the wealth management business, helping to lower costs and facilitate the launch of digital features like SmartWealth. The project to unify the IT structure began in 2013, with UBS aiming to have it finished by end-2018.</p>

<h2 id="pick-3-didi-sets-sights-on-lucrative-web-finance-sector">Pick #3. Didi sets sights on lucrative web finance sector</h2>

<p>Didi Chuxing, China’s largest ride-hailing company, acquired a much-coveted license to enter the internet finance sector. Didi has agreed to acquire third-party payment-services provider 19Pay for 300 million yuan ($45.4 million), according to a filing by Shenzhen-listed GoHigh Data Networks Technology Co, the owner of 19Pay.</p>

<p>The deal will give Didi a license to conduct online-payment business, enabling it to enter an industry dominated by its investors Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd. Didi made the investment through its wholly owned subsidiary Shanghai Shiyuan Technology.</p>

<p>Didi told China Daily that the license will be used to serve its transportation services and improve the user experience.</p>

<h2 id="pick-4-kenyas-fintech-companies-are-innovating-to-bring-small-businesses-into-their-fold">Pick #4. Kenya’s FinTech companies are innovating to bring small businesses into their fold</h2>

<p>Mobile operators and electronic payment firms are focusing on the hundreds of thousands of small businesses in Kenya by introducing new products specifically aimed at paying for low-value card transactions with ease, speed, and convenience.</p>

<p>PesaPal, a Nairobi-based aggregator for online and mobile payments, recently introduced a mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) service known as Sabi (Pidgin English for ‘understand’) that would process payments in both local and US dollar currencies. Using their Android phones or tablets, the Visa or Mastercard payments are processed over Bluetooth by connecting to a portable terminal. The technology allows the over 300 businesses in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania that have signed up so far to view their transaction history and to issue receipts.</p>

<p>After launching POS systems to rival similar products like PayPal and Square to target large chains, PesaPal CEO Agosta Liko tells Quartz the mobile portal will tap into the potential of smaller businesses like barbershops, artisan furniture stores, gyms, and craft stores by allowing consumers to make payments from as little as one Kenyan shilling ($0.009). It’s a “big market. It’s a ridiculously big space,” Liko said. “So we are looking to that as a market that we would be able to serve reliably.”</p>

In this <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/mobile-white-paper-c11-520862.html">study</a>, Cisco explains that mobile video will grow at a CAGR of 62% between 2015 and 2020, higher than the overall average mobile traffic CAGR of 53%. Of the 30.6 exabytes per month crossing the mobile network by 2020, Cisco estimates that 23.0 exabytes will be due to video. Mobile video represented more than half of global mobile data traffic beginning in 2012, indicating that it is already affecting traffic today, not just in the future.</p>

<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/bank-branches-are-not-dying-they-are-evolving-into-video-banking/">Video has been noticed as an attractive platform for commercial interaction by financial institutions </a>that review it as a possible alternative for physical branches. In-video payments systems are not limited to commercials and other forms of short features, good ol’ product placement can finally be employed on the spot. A major advantage of in-video payments, in this case, is in the ability to measure the effectiveness of spent funds and significantly boost the profitability of any business.</p>

<h2 id="pick-1-levis-debuts-shoppable-video-for-holiday-gift-inspiration">Pick #1. Levi’s debuts shoppable video for holiday gift inspiration</h2>

<p>Shoppable video is picking up traction as brands and retailers seek to lessen friction on the consumer path to purchase, and this latest version from Levi’s stands out due to its simplicity and short length. The video offers something of a torrent of products for consumers but allows shoppers to skip any hard sales pitches or other promotions. If a viewer is interested in something they see, all it takes is a click to add that product to a virtual cart. The e-commerce element is fairly simple, and the user experience is interactive, engaging and seamless, particularly when someone wants to make a quick purchase and doesn’t quite know where to begin.</p>

<h2 id="pick-2-two-big-banks-set-to-launch-their-own-online-lending-platforms">Pick #2. Two Big Banks Set to Launch Their Own Online Lending Platforms</h2>

<p>Barclays Enters Online Consumer Lending. UK-based Barclays has been increasing their footprint in the US the last few years through the Barclaycard brand. They are now one of the top 10 credit card issuers in the US. News broke last month that Barclays would be launching a digital bank in 2018 and rebranding from Barclaycard to Barclays in the US. An integral part of this strategy will be an unsecured consumer loan offering, something they have been testing since late 2016. They are targeting prime and super-prime borrowers, loans will range from $5,000 and $35,000 and can be repaid in three, four or five years. The interest rates range from 4.99% to 18.99% and the loans carry no origination fees or prepayment penalties. They plan to launch fully in 2018 as they have originated about 15,000 loans to date through the testing phase.</p>

<p>PNC Financial Services. Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services Group is one of the top 10 largest banks in the US with $371 billion in assets. They are looking to launch their online consumer lending product in new branches and through their mobile wallet product. The new platform is expected to launch in 2018. This is a bit out of the ordinary for the bank as they have not yet had a nationwide offering like this, instead focusing on the 19 states where they have established a presence. The new product will help with their rollout to new branch markets in Minneapolis, Dallas, and Kansas City. This looks to be part of a wider digital overhaul the bank has been doing the last few years as it seeks to service customers in a more digital fashion.</p>

<h2 id="pick-3-estonias-tech-guru-outlines-ideas-for-digital-estcoin">Pick #3. Estonia’s tech guru outlines ideas for digital ‘estcoin’</h2>

<p>Estonia could become the first country in Europe to launch its own digital means of exchange – the “estcoin” – under plans outlined by Kaspar Korjus, the manager of Estonia’s pioneering e-residency scheme, in place since 2014.</p>

<p>Kaspar Korjus said in a blog post that the estcoin would be aimed at the Baltic country’s 27,000 e-residents – foreigners who open a company there via the web – but would not be a parallel currency to rival the euro.</p>

<p>Korjus said estcoins could serve one of three purposes: rewarding services to the e-resident community, verifying one’s identity online, or as a means of payment pegged to the euro. “All three of these models of estcoin are viable and can be introduced (even without alarming the European Central Bank),” Korjus wrote in the blog post.</p>

                <title>In 2018, Banks Will Start Buying FinTechs, Investing More, and Learn to Benchmark Innovation</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/2017/12/20/in-2018-banks-will-start-buying-fintechs-investing-more-and-learn-to-benchmark-innovation/</link>
                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>In our discussions lately with CXOs and innovation heads of major banks, we have been seeing an interesting trend shaping up. Many of them are trying to find ways to measure the success (or failure) of innovation programs and accelerators – essentially trying to find the KPIs for benchmarking innovation (internal and external data). Some of them even said, “We will be looking to buy those startups. It’s not just about collaborative innovation.”</p>

<p>I think what we are going to witness is how innovation takes a corporate development turn from here. It will not be a full U-turn but maybe the splitting of teams into two and sending them in different directions. If you believe in FinTech and want to make a bigger play, an accelerator program is only one piece of the puzzle. Remember the original reasons why all this “FinTech” thing started:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>End-customers demanded everything to happen in four clicks on their mobile phones. The next-gen financial services experience built by startups became a growing phenomenon. All these lead to a fairly new set of expectations from banks and FIs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Banks needed a comprehensive digital transformation strategy to make this happen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there was a problem. There was a lack of time, skills, infrastructure, and also, the right culture to do it. So most banks chose the easy and quick steps – let’s bring about a perception change by organizing and participating in startup events, hackathons, third-party accelerators, et al; let’s launch a few new mobile apps/applications here and there, and talk about omnichannel.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of them were able to build a bigger and more meaningful roadmap. They set up an innovation office and have a structured innovation program including shortlisting startups and had their own bank accelerator. Good start. And to be fair, it’s okay to make mistakes and learn and evolve. Any bank which has reached this stage is worthy of appreciation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It doesn’t take more than two to three years to realize that even that is not enough. There are questions about the ROI of these investments. How do we make sure it’s helping with our core #1 and #2 objectives? And those are the key conversations you need to have if you are a bank.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Comprehensive digital transformation is a big, big undertaking. It’s almost as if you are setting up a new organization. I am not going to go into too much detail on what it is and how it should be done. Please see my note* at the bottom to know more.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>But what I am going to discuss is something that is going to be an important part of the comprehensive digital transformation and specifically one part of it as it relates to working with startups. And that is where the funds and corporate development and the M&amp;A machinery of the bank (old or new that will be set up) will come into the picture. Why will this happen?</p>

<p>As explained by a bank that when we acquire or invest and take a board seat, we can guide the strategic product roadmap. In a typical no-commitment collaborative experimentation, startups keep focusing on 10 different things. This is also because banks don’t show them the right level of seriousness. Even in an accelerator program, sometimes there is a conflict of interest as startups don’t want to change their path for a half-baked and lightweight commitment. It’s a chicken and egg problem. Once the bank’s money is invested, it is important to see the results for the bank. There will be more seriousness and startups will be able to move things, ship, integrate, and go to market quickly. As banks look to benchmark innovation, investing in FinTechs looks like a major move in 2018.</p>

<p>This is FinServ; it is different. This is not telecom where you can make incumbents look like dump pipes. Even if you can, you will have to have a completely new financial system that doesn’t favor banks and provides a level playing field for small and big FinTechs – a new tech layer on which to operate. Is that the cryptocurrency/blockchain world? I don’t know yet. Incumbents in this space move fast and are not going to give up becoming digital and FinTechy. In fact, they were early adopters of technology as compared to any other sector and they will beg, borrow or steal but certainly try. They will buy or build.</p>

<p>There is some good data available that I can use here to back my arguments. Some of this activity has already started:</p>

<p><strong>Allianz converted one of their innovation labs into a VC arm</strong> – <a href="https://www.dig-in.com/news/allianz-converts-innovation-lab-into-insurtech-vc-arm">Allianz has announced </a>the changeover of its in-house incubator, Allianz X, into a new venture capital investment arm intended to bolster digital and core technology. As part of the pivot in strategy, the German insurer will discontinue all early-stage projects and heavily invest in startups with expertise in mobility, connected property, connected health, wealth management, data intelligence and cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Ally Financial had bought online brokerage TradeKing Group in a $275-million deal. In India, Axis Bank’s acquired FreeCharge. BlackRock also decided to tap into FinTech with the $150-million acquisition of FutureAdvisor, an online investment firm. JPMorgan Chase acquired WePay, a small-business-focused payments company. In the last three years, Silicon Valley Bank acquired Standard Treasury, BBVA acquired Simple, and Ally acquired TradeKing. BNP Paribas completed the acquisition of Compte-Nickel this year as well. **And we have a whole list with us; **we have had several discussions with FIs.</p>

<p>In 2018, you may finally see new venture arms/funds of FIs/banks coming up. You will see more action from existing venture arms of banks. In some banks who may not have these arms or may not call them that, you will see corporate development and M&amp;A teams getting into action. How will the innovation team and the investment group play it out in the market? Will they compete or work together? Who will take the lead? These are going to be some of the important operational questions.</p>

<p><strong>But will it make sense for the FinTech startups to have banks as investors and buyers?</strong></p>

<p>From a startup’s perspective, the narrative has changed – it’s going from breaking banks/total disruption, to partnering/working with banks, to also raising money/getting acquired by banks. What’s wrong with that? Startups need scale, right? “New tech” being acquired by the old companies – it’s a win-win situation.</p>

<p>So, Oracle bought Apiary, Palerra, Eloqua and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Oracle">so on</a>, and Apple acquired Shazam, Workflow, Siri and more – all these companies that were bought are in a bigger world (scale) today and witnessing growth at a global level.</p>

<p>Of course, there will be exceptions. There will be a few FinTechs in each region who will achieve scale like Klarna, Sofi, Paytm, and will not want to sell. Sure, but I might argue that there is an interesting thing happening there as well – they are becoming banks: TechBanks. (My next article is coming soon).</p>

<p>*If you are a Chief Innovation Officer or a CDO of a bank and if you have started thinking about this or if your CEO/board has started asking you questions about ROI, please talk to us. We have a primer/workshop and discussion material on this to get you started.</p>

<p>For us, it has always been about FinTech foresight based on what we see as a global FinTech think tank and platform/community. We have been a leading indicator of sorts for the things to come in FinTech. In 2013, it was crypto; in 2014 – blockchain; 2015 – bank innovation programs/accelerators, and so on. And this is one of the things we foresee for 2018, and there are others as well. Do let us know your feedback and comments.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Just like the guys who produced and sold shovels made a lot more fortune during the gold rush, something similar is happening in the Bitcoin world – there is an equivalent. Just look at the crypto exchanges, the hot and cold wallets (hardware), Google Authenticator (2FA), and so on.</p>

<h2 id="pick-1-coinbase-the-heart-of-the-bitcoin-frenzy">Pick #1. Coinbase: The Heart of the Bitcoin Frenzy</h2>

<p>Read about the crypto exchange Coinbase. A fascinating story of a startup that has so much demand that it’s struggling to keep up.</p>

<h2 id="pick-3-blockchain-based-cross-border-payment-beta-platform-announced-by-sbi-bankchain-members--microsoft">Pick #3. Blockchain-Based Cross-Border Payment Beta Platform Announced by SBI, BankChain Members &amp; Microsoft</h2>

<p>Primechain-P5, a unique blockchain-based platform for cross-border remittance, was announced at the Future Money Conference 2017 in Mumbai by Sudin Baraokar, Head of Innovation at the State Bank of India.</p>

<p>P5 features 59-second global remittances at a near-zero fee on a 24×7 basis as well as automated reconciliation. The platform uses Microsoft Azure APIs for machine learning-based fraud detection systems and real-time anti-money laundering checks. Additionally, many of the P5 nodes will run on the Azure cloud. The platform also does away with the need for nostro/vostro accounts and features 100% API-driven technology.</p>

<p>Some of the banks who are exploring P5 include State Bank of India, Emirates NBD, and DCB Bank.</p>

<p>P5 has been developed by Primechain Technologies, a young blockchain startup, for members of BankChain – a community of banks for exploring, building, and implementing blockchain solutions. Formed in February 2017 with the State Bank of India (one of the largest banks in the world) being the first member, BankChain now has 30 members globally.</p>

<p>Speaking at the launch, Sudin Baraokar, Head of Innovation at State Bank of India said that P5 solves the six pain points of today’s global payments systems – inefficient onboarding, vulnerable Know Your Customer (KYC), cost and delay of global remittances, propensity for error, mandatory liquidity requirement, and demanding regulatory compliance.</p>

<p>According to Prasanna Lohar, Head of Technology – Innovation &amp; Architecture, DCB Bank, “(The year) 2017 brought with it a wave of innovations and adoption of blockchain through collaboration among banks at BankChain. The need for efficient cross-border payments is overwhelming and the demand for faster cross-border payments is growing with the rise of global e-commerce. Adoption of blockchain-based cross-border payments will lead us to reduce the settlement time, removal of manual intervention, and lower the cost of completing global payments for businesses &amp; consumers.”</p>

<p>According to Peter Gartenberg, General Manager – Enterprise Commercial, Microsoft India, “Blockchain has the power to help organizations to transact within an ecosystem with secured, transparent, shared and immutable information. Microsoft is working closely with global and local consortiums to understand core industry scenarios and create blockchain solutions for them. We are happy to partner with BankChain as its exclusive cloud partner to provide global scale, hybrid cloud capabilities, extensive compliance certification portfolio, and enterprise-grade security that is helping to fast-track blockchain adoption amongst banks in India.”</p>

<p>“Primechain-P5 is one of the most exciting developments in the field of global payments today. We’ve partnered with Microsoft Azure for maximum security, scalability, and stability,” said Shinam Arora, CEO, Primechain Technologies.</p>

<p>We at LTP and MEDICI are a <a href="http://www.bankchain.org.in/members.php">strategic partner</a> for BankChain.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Patent Overview from September 2017.</p>

<p>To capture the massive growth of blockchain and DLT patents over the last several years, Let’s Talk Payments has partnered with Carneros Bay to release a complete analysis of the Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies patents market.</p>

<p>Ever since the anonymous drop of Bitcoin’s whitepaper and open source code in 2009, its  underlying distributed ledger technology (DLT) has seen significant mainstream interest. Ethereum is notably one of the most popular large-scale implementations of Blockchain which are inspired by the Bitcoin whitepaper. The potential benefits of blockchain and DLT wasn’t lost on global financial services firms. Banks, consulting companies, and other financial institutions quickly revved up their R&amp;D efforts, created consortiums, and continue to invest in DLT and cryptocurrencies. The result? A massive surge in blockchain patents.</p>

<p>The report cites data from the prestigious and well-known Thomson Innovation patent databases recorded from January 1, 2008 to August 28, 2017. A preliminary search resulted in a staggering number of 2633 patents, which reduced to a credible 1633 after human screening for relevancy &amp; categorization.</p>

<p>The report helps identify discernible pattern of patent activity across countries, industries and major technology heavy-weights. The top patent assignees are a mix of technology, finance, communication companies. It highlights the cross-industry reach of cryptocurrency, electronic transactions and blockchain. Filers include the technology companies (Coinbase, Coinplug, IBM), financial institutions (TD Bank, Bank of America, Fidelity), payment providers (Mastercard) and social media sites (Facebook) along with unusual assignees (Arkeytyp IP, Wal-Mart, AT&amp;T). Some of the interesting trends show that filings are shifting away from the US to the rest of the world along with an increased focus on specific use cases and applications as opposed to core technology filings. This type of filing pattern tends to emerge when the core technologies are more mature and defined thus allowing for specific uses cases to be established.</p>

<p>We’re excited to see what other insights you can extract from this report.</p>

<p>Note: Given that filings have an 18-month publication blackout from date of filing the data for 2016 is incomplete and will be until mid-2018.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Despite constituting more than 43% of the workforce, women occupy only 37% of positions from management in Brazil, according to the IBGE Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics.</p>

<p>In startups, there is a culture of valuing people without the distinction of sex, appearance, and other codes that are relevant for traditional companies. Items like tattoos or colored hair, for example, are no problem in the selection process. But are the opportunities in startups the same for women?</p>

<h2 id="what-they-say-what-its-like-to-be-a-woman-in-a-startup">What they say: what it’s like to be a woman in a startup</h2>

<p>There is still no specific study on gender in startups, so I’ve talked to some women who work in financial startups – a traditionally male-dominated sector – to know about their day-to-day experiences, prospects, and gender bias.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/wo1.jpg" alt="wo1.jpg" /></p>

<p>Stephanie Fleury, Founder – DinDin App</p>

<p>For <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tetifleury/">Stéphanie Fleury</a>, Founder of the <a href="https://www.appdindin.com.br/">DinDin application</a>, gender bias is no longer the problem, but it is a lack of voice and visibility for women who are already on the market.</p>

<p>Before undertaking her own company, Stéphanie worked for years in telecommunications. She soon realized that to stand out, it was not enough to have an opinion; it was necessary to have courage, to manifest and to introduce oneself in order to be heard and remembered.</p>

<p>Before the DinDin application, Stéphanie had already founded companies in the marketing and tourism sectors, which helped detect the problem that she solves today with her startup.</p>

<p>“No doubt, the prejudice has existed, like when I was a trainee back in 2002; I worked in the telecom market which was predominantly male. Today, although there are still some cases where there is more respect when there is a man in the room, they are rare. Today, I feel more respect and admiration on the other side of the table than the opposite,” said Stéphanie.</p>

<h3 id="the-equalizing-power-of-innovation">The equalizing power of innovation</h3>

<p>In an innovative sector, it is easier to be heard and recognized, regardless of gender. This is the impression of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anavitoriabaraldi/">Ana Vitória Baraldi</a>, who has worked in a traditional bank and is Head of Customer Relationship and Asset Manager at <a href="https://verios.com.br/">Vérios </a>today. “When you’re in a big company, it’s harder to be heard – here at Vérios, I feel like I’m being heard and I think this has to do with the environment of FinTech.”</p>

<p>But the inside of the company is not the only one a woman faces as a professional. As Head of Customer Experience, Ana says she often answer customers, and has had to listen to unnecessary comments such as pick-up lines, which the all-female attendance team experiences from time to time.</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning that Ana is in an egalitarian milieu in Vérios, where half the staff is comprised of men. But among asset managers, a woman is almost a rarity. According to the survey I made with the public data of the CVM, among the 100 managers who currently have a valid certificate issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM), only 5 of them are women.</p>

<h3 id="entrepreneurship-as-a-path-to-inclusion">Entrepreneurship as a path to inclusion</h3>

<p>Another woman who has been among minorities since university was Ingrid Barth, Head of Corporate Banking at <a href="https://www.banconeon.com.br/">Banco Neon</a>, and a graduate in engineering and economics. Ingrid notes how there has been an increase in the number of women in both areas in recent years.</p>

<p>She also believes that the startup environment is more responsive than the traditional one. “I see the difference because in innovative companies like startups, businesses are more horizontal, so you have more process agility and more chance to give ideas and be heard.”</p>

<p>Ingrid says that it still so happens that men usually respond to other men in the room even if she is ahead of the meeting or is superior to the others in hierarchy but that it is less likely to happen nowadays.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Machine learning applications are storing the <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/how-banks-regulators-are-applying-machine-learning/">financial services industry with institutions and regulatory bodies putting technology into real use</a>. Real-world applications, however, are not where the change happens as talented scientists are looking to revolutionize the hardware behind machines with quantum computing capabilities. Rigetti Computing, a company based in California, is a curious example and a source of important findings.</p>

<h2 id="pick-1-a-startup-uses-quantum-computing-to-boost-machine-learning">Pick #1. A Startup Uses Quantum Computing to Boost Machine Learning</h2>

<p>Researchers at <a href="http://www.rigetti.com/">Rigetti Computing</a>, a company based in Berkeley, California, used one of its prototype quantum chips – a superconducting device housed within an elaborate super-chilled setup – to run what’s known as a clustering algorithm. Clustering is a machine-learning technique used to organize data into similar groups. Rigetti is also making the new quantum computer – which can handle 19 quantum bits, or qubits – available through its cloud computing platform, called Forest, today.</p>

<p>“This is a new path toward practical applications for quantum computers. Clustering is a really fundamental and foundational mathematical problem. No one has ever shown you can do this.” – Will Zeng, Head of Software &amp; Applications at Rigetti.</p>

<p>There is currently a remarkable amount of excitement surrounding efforts to develop practical quantum computers. Big technology companies, including IBM, Google, Intel, and Microsoft, as well as a few well-funded startups are racing to build exotic machines that promise to usher in a fundamentally new form of computing.</p>

<p>IBM recently announced that it has built a quantum computer with 50 qubits, and Google is widely rumored to have a device of similar scale. The company also revealed a range of partners for its quantum project, including JPMorgan Chase, Daimler AG, Samsung, Hitachi, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. These companies want to see what quantum machines might be able to do in a range of applications including financial modeling, chemistry, and route optimization.</p>

<p>There is good evidence that quantum machines can be used to solve cryptographic challenges and to simulate new material. And there is hope that algorithms such as Rigetti’s will eventually transform the world of machine learning and AI.</p>

<h2 id="pick-2-overstock-is-turning-into-a-bitcoin-tech-company">Pick #2. Overstock is turning into a Bitcoin tech company</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-m-byrne-0b8380a7/">Patrick Byrne</a>, the CEO of Overstock.com, wants to possibly sell off the retail business and focus on Overstock’s ownership of 10 blockchain companies through its venture capital subsidiary, Medici Ventures. He has also formed a joint venture with Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto called De Soto, Inc., a company that would use blockchain technology to form a property registry providing land rights to people in the developing world.</p>

<p>“Blockchain is going to change the world more, I think, than the internet has,” said Byrne, who believes that many people will gradually abandon government-backed currencies if more countries encounter currency failures like in Zimbabwe and Venezuela.</p>

<h2 id="pick-3-the-first-100-billion-dollar-blockchain-company-could-be-the-next-sap">Pick #3. The First $100-Billion-Dollar Blockchain Company Could Be the Next SAP</h2>

<p>I see today’s enterprise blockchain startups and those in the coming years as the next generation of enterprise database companies. SAP has a market cap of over $135 billion with over $23 billion in revenues last year, and Oracle has a market cap of over $209 billion with over $37 billion in revenues. Oracle positions itself as the world’s number one enterprise database company with dozens of core products from middleware solutions to servers to databases.</p>

<p>The next generation of global enterprise database companies might not just be based on technologies acquired from the region, but wholly originated from Asia. For example, Blocko, which went through our accelerator in Seoul in 2015, has become the leading enterprise blockchain company in South Korea with over 90% market share. Their blockchain-as-a-service platform, Coinstack, has been implemented at Samsung, LG CNS, Hyundai, and many other multi-billion corporations. For the Korea Exchange, they created a blockchain-based OTC trading market, which decreased transaction time from two to three days to one day. This resulted in cost savings of $73 million this past year.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>While financial use cases of blockchain technology are at the spotlight due to the significant interest of powerful parties – banks, investors, and even <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/government-blockchain-relationships-2017/">governments</a>– non-financial use cases of DLT are of equally significant importance to a number of industries. Along with banks and FinTech startups, non-financial players have been paying attention and looking for ways to leverage the opportunities that DLT opens. Let’s look at some <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/21-areas-of-blockchain-application-beyond-financial-services/">interesting examples of the applications of blockchain technology beyond financial services</a>:</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>With demand comes supply, and the old truth proved to be working in 2017 when we saw a significant proliferation of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/what-does-a-wise-decision-on-ico-look-like/">Regulatory bodies have come through for an innovative way to fund an enterprise</a>, extending the opportunity to invest to larger audiences.</p>

<p>The total amount raised by startups via ICOs reached nearly $800 million in value in Q2 2017. Combined with the first quarter, that total ICO funds raised during the first half of the year came in at $1.13 billion, TechCrunch reports. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ico-tracker/">CoinDesk’s ICO tracker</a> shows that from January 2017 to the end of November 2017, the volume of funding collected through ICOs reached close to $3.48 billion.</p>

<p>To meet the demand for the latest funding model, a range of companies started offering ICO launching services.</p>

<p><a href="https://icobox.io/">ICO Box</a> offers a tiered suite of services for companies launching their ICOs. Basic service includes a solution for token development (ERC-20 simple token to simplify integration with exchanges and other services, smart contract management system), book building platform, legal services for compliance with US regulations, and, as a bonus, business and marketing consulting. Startups can accept payments for tokens in fiat and 70+ coins. ICO Box offers technology package and legal package separately for companies that seek only or another part of the solution.</p>

<p>Another example is <a href="https://tokenmarket.net/ico-professional-services">ICO Launchpad by TokenMarket</a> with a core product providing everything from token creation to token sale. The company has built decentralized services including exchanges, smart contracts for large ICOs, and on-demand code auditing. The areas in which the company provides assistance are KYC, capital conversions, investor outreach, marketing, multisig wallets, milestone-based escrow, partial underwriting.</p>

<p><a href="https://ibcgroup.io/">IBC</a> – International Blockchain Consulting – offers a full stack of ICO services that include ICO Technical (platform and smart contract creation, coding, testing, and implementation, code security audit), ICO Financial (financial planning and strategy, book building and book running services, escrow services, multisig wallet management, financial reporting and auditing, investor outreach and coordination), ICO Legal (international AML/KYC support, jurisdiction analysis, white paper creation, fund liquidation and distribution, etc.), ICO Marketing, Post ICO Services, Reverse ICO Services.</p>

<p><a href="http://blockstarter.co/#">BlockStarter</a> is a simpler service – the company offers a platform to list an ICO with a tokesale dashboard that includes features like token balance, token calculator, crowdsale progress tracking, transaction history review, etc. Startups can draft their campaigns on the platform, and once they have described their campaign, it will be shown to all contributors that visit BlockStarter (the platform claims to have thousands).</p>

<p>Similarly to the first few examples, <a href="https://icopromo.com/">ICOpromo</a> offers a suite of services that include technology and marketing solutions. Technology solutions include smart contract framework, smart contract management system, SaaS crowdfunding platform, bounty tracking portal, consultations by developers on setting up the technology tools, Distributed Applications Design and UX, development, and security audits. Marketing solutions include marketing strategy, bounty program set up to conduct marketing campaigns in 25 languages, consultations by marketing experts on the deployment of marketing tools.</p>

<p><a href="http://usa.elephant-marketing.com/">Elephant Marketing</a> is a more marketing-focused shop for startups, unlike some of the previous examples. The company offers various tariffs for suites of marketing-focused services rather than technology. The tech services include ICO launch website developments – private-office web system, site design, frontend, backend. The marketing part includes all services that have been listed in previous options – business plan, white paper, etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://icoo.io/">ICOO</a> offers an ICO startup package that is customizable, but general outlines of services include content creation, video use case, and an escrow service during ICO (the fee is 0.5% of total amount achieved and minimum $3,000). Services also include full integration with the OpenLedger platform at launch time, prelaunch ICO of same with buy wall to ensure no dumping below ICO price, marketing, and advertising services.</p>

<p><a href="https://tokenhub.com/ico">TokenHub</a> is probably the most tech-oriented ICO service platform among the reviewed ones, which offers a turnkey solution to set up, run and manage ICOs. The company takes care of: developing proprietary own smart contract tokens, shaping a legal model suitable for each case, advertising and PR for the ICO, fundraising, token emission, providing specialized wallets to hold and transfer the tokens, listing on a digital asset exchange. Turnkey solution for issuers include a proprietary legal model which guarantees minimal risks and full legal compliance, customizable smart contracts with quick implementation, full range of payment solutions to suit all types of clients, scalable and flexible to simplify new and follow-on offerings, full regulatory assurance, NYCEX listing (the world’s first exchange with a smart contract trading tool). For buyers, TokenHub offers smooth token purchase and management. Buyers can participate in all major credit and debit cards, ACH, PayPal, Alipay, Bitcoin, and Ether.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whiteboard.vc/accelerator.html">Whiteboard Venture Partners</a> is a different sort of a player – it’s a pre-ICO business accelerator. Whiteboard.VC along with its co-investors will invest at least $90,000 in a select number of pre-ICO startups. Its team is working with startups to get them into the best possible shape and refine their ICO pitch for a global market of investors. Fall 2017 batch includes 2 stealth phase startups and a company called Securecoin Capital. Whiteboard.VC is accepting applications for its business accelerator Spring 2018 Initial Coin Offering funding cycle. Selected pre-ICO startups will be engaged from February – May 2018.</p>

<p>One last example is <a href="https://coinlist.co/">CoinList</a>, which emerged as an independent company from AngelList and Protocol Labs’ collaboration running the <a href="https://coinlist.co/filecoin">Filecoin</a> token sale. The platform is built primarily for token creators. Its infrastructure has been used to handle over $850 million in investments, between those made on AngelList and those on CoinList. The team behind the company worked to develop an audited, bank-grade compliance process, performing KYC and AML compliance due diligence and investor accreditation, when it’s relevant.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ambisafe.co/">Ambisafe</a> offers bundles of services for issuers, exchanges, middleware services, and third-party services. Middleware services are the most extensive ones and include supernode, notification service, keystore, security oracle, Ether faucet, enterprise Bitcoin server, and transaction history.</p>

<p>Mentioned companies neither comprise an exhaustive list nor represent the best options for startups to consider. Abovementioned examples explore the width of the service industry that was built in the past year around the latest obsession of the tech world – ICOs.</p>

                <title>Daily Review: Gibraltar Launches World’s First License for FinTech Firms Using Blockchain</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/2017/12/15/daily-review-gibraltar-launches-worlds-first-license-for-fintech-firms-using-blockchain/</link>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Developments in blockchain technology have taken a leap to a whole new level – the first license for FinTech firms using blockchain distributed ledger technology has been introduced by Gibraltar’s financial services watchdog. From whitepapers, to PoC, to real-world applications and deployments, blockchain-focused startups now have a place in the official books.</p>

<h2 id="pick-1-gibraltar-launches-worlds-first-license-for-fintech-firms-using-blockchain">Pick #1. Gibraltar launches world’s first license for FinTech firms using blockchain</h2>

<p>Gibraltar’s financial services watchdog will introduce the world’s first license for FinTech firms using blockchain distributed ledger technology from next month in a bid to attract startups to the British overseas territory as it prepares for Brexit.</p>

<p>The Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) will publish the guidelines on Friday for applying its new law for firms that use blockchain to “transmit or store” cash and assets belonging to others – much in the same way as a bank is authorized.</p>

<p>“This is the first instance of a purpose-built legislative framework for businesses that use blockchain or distributed ledger technology.” – Nicky Gomez, the GFSC’s Head of Risk &amp; Innovation.</p>

<p>There will be two main advantages to firms being authorized under the new rules: it will make it easier to obtain a bank account to run the business, and it helps a business gain legitimacy with customers.</p>

<h2 id="pick-2-andrew-ng-says-factories-are-ais-next-frontier">Pick #2. Andrew Ng Says Factories Are AI’s Next Frontier</h2>

<p>Andrew Ng is the CEO of a startup called <a href="http://www.landing.ai/">Landing.AI</a> that will help companies figure out ways to incorporate AI. Specifically, Landing.AI (California), is working with manufacturers—including Foxconn, the world’s largest contract manufacturer and maker of Apple’s iPhones—to figure out how AI can help with product yield and quality control.</p>

<p>Ng says he’s interested in manufacturing in particular because it touches so much of our everyday lives. He sees it as a way to bring a digital transformation to the physical world.</p>

<p>Ng won’t say exactly how Landing.AI’s technology will be rolled out by Foxconn or other manufacturers on manufacturing lines. But he expects it will include visual inspections, and his team has developed a learning algorithm that, after being trained on just a few images, can be used to spot imperfections in small electronic components or camera lenses. Landing.AI believes it understands how to use AI to tune the operations of manufacturing machines such as injection-molding machines.</p>

<h2 id="pick-3-2-tech-giants-are-teaming-up-for-the-internet-of-things">Pick #3. 2 Tech Giants Are Teaming Up for the Internet of Things</h2>

<p>Amazon and Texas Instruments were collaborating on an integrated offering for the Internet of Things.</p>

<p>At its recent Re: Invent conference, Amazon announced AWS FreeRTOS, a new open-source operating system for microcontrollers in IoT devices. The two companies teamed up to integrate Texas Instruments’ SimpleLink MCU Platform with FreeRTOS prior to the new operating system’s unveiling. The collaboration will make the combined microcontroller easily pluggable into Amazon’s IoT platform.</p>

<p>Through FreeRTOS, developers can program, connect, and monitor their devices more easily. That will save IoT software developers lots of time and headaches and can speed up deployment for businesses that want to quickly implement IoT devices.</p>

<h2 id="pick-4-jpmorgan-chase-and-samsung-are-partnering-with-ibm-to-build-business-apps-on-quantum-computers">Pick #4. JPMorgan Chase and Samsung Are Partnering With IBM To Build Business Apps On Quantum Computers</h2>

<p>IBM is partnering with corporations including Daimler AG, JPMorgan Chase, and Samsung to see if there’s money to be made in quantum. Those companies are part of the first batch of partners in what IBM is calling its “Q Network,” a group that will have access to IBM’s quantum systems and share engineering over the next several years.</p>

<p>Partners in the Q Network now have access through the cloud to IBM’s 20-qubit computers. With IBM already running a successful 50 qubit prototype, partners will access more advanced quantum computers over the course of the relationship. IBM’s goal is for its partners to develop applications that demonstrate a business advantage because they run on quantum instead of traditional computers using silicon-based chips. IBM hopes to see such success by 2020.</p>

<p>Partners such as JPMorgan Chase will send engineers to IBM’s research lab in Yorktown Heights, New York and share research back with the company on a regular basis, while also conducting experiments remotely over the cloud.</p>

<p>Eventual applications could perform risk analysis or adjust prices more quickly in finance, making it easier to develop new materials in manufacturing and optimize logistics faster, but to do so, the companies must learn how to run the underlying algorithms of those applications on a quantum computer, among other challenges. Others involved in the program include Barclays, Hitachi Metals, Honda, JSR Corporation, and Nagase.</p>

<h2 id="pick-5-moodys-outlook-for-cee-banks-is-stable-as-strong-economic-growth-boosts-lending">Pick #5. Moody’s Outlook for CEE banks is stable as strong economic growth boosts lending</h2>

<p>The economic growth in the CEE region is expected to be in a range between 2.4% and 3.8% during 2018.</p>

<p>“With employment rising, increasing domestic demand will support credit growth. SME lending is underdeveloped, but will expand gradually,” said Carola Schuler, a Managing Director at Moody’s. The relatively low level of private sector debt leaves ample room for credit expansion, but the underwriting quality in some of the rapidly growing lending segments will be tested as these loans mature.</p>

<p>Slovenian, Romanian and Hungarian banks’ loan book quality has improved over the past three years, following significant balance sheet clean-up efforts and government measures, but Czech and Slovak banks’ high exposure to single borrowers and the high growth mortgage sector will continue to be a source of risk.</p>

                <title>Building the Most Advanced Prepaid Card Management &amp; Stored Value Solution in the World – Interview With Brion Bonkowski, Founder &amp; CEO of Tern Commerce</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/2017/12/14/building-the-most-advanced-prepaid-card-management-and-stored-value-solution-in-the-world-interview-with-brion-bonkowski-founder-and-ceo-of-tern-commerce/</link>
                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>I had the pleasure of speaking with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brionbonkowski/">Brion Bonkowski</a>, the Founder &amp; CEO of <a href="http://www.terncommerce.com/">Tern Commerce</a>, a company created to help brands launch global prepaid and stored value programs through its SPAN platform, which covers user experience (UX), compliance, identity verification, and cross-border remittance.</p>

<p>Brion is a business leader in the payments and technology space, and also serves as the Managing Director of <a href="http://www.roipayments.com/">ROI Payments</a>, an NYC-based tech consultancy and holds a number of executive and board appointments in the technology, payments, and non-profit sectors.</p>

<p>More impressively, Brion has summited Mt. Kilimanjaro five times! In 2013, he was appointed Chairman of the <a href="http://www.kiusa.org/">Kilimanjaro Initiative USA</a>, a non-profit organization. In 2017, Brion was invited to become a member of the Young Entrepreneurs Council, a global network of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs aged 40 and younger.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/tern.png" alt="tern.png" /></p>

<p>Josh Goodman: Brion thanks for joining us today. Why don’t we start off with you telling us a little bit about yourself and about Tern Commerce?</p>

<p>Brion Bonkowski: Sure, happy to. I have spent my entire career in the payments and technology space. Starting in 2010, my partners and I identified a need for a modern prepaid platform with cross-border capabilities. We spent the next five years meeting with regulators, assembling legal opinions, and interviewing potential partners and options. In 2015, we officially launched Tern Commerce and in December of that year, we acquired a company called <a href="https://www.usunlocked.com/">US Unlocked</a> to help jumpstart our vision.</p>

<p>JG: How would US Unlocked help you achieve your cross-border vision?</p>

<p>BB: US Unlocked had been successfully operating the only US issued virtual card program for global consumers since 2008. US Unlocked’s technology and team lined up very well with our plan to build a superior global prepaid platform. Immediately following the acquisition, Tern began the process of modernizing the US Unlocked IP to a modern framework with multi-tenant capabilities to accommodate a variety of different types of programs. Building on years of best practices from US Unlocked, the Tern team built a product to manage and operate global prepaid programs – our new commercial platform, SPAN.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>                             ![tern1.png](/uploads/tern1.png)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>JG: Why the focus on prepaid?</p>

<p>BB: The structure of prepaid gives us a lot of flexibility in launching programs with a number of different use cases. Prepaid programs have been around for a long time, they gained popularity with payroll cards until changing regulations made those programs significantly less attractive for people who run such programs (program managers). Today, prepaid cards are used for a variety of interesting use cases, especially among FinTech firm focused on decreasing friction in moving money. With this change from payroll card to FinTech instruments – products like virtual cards, one-time use cards, limited use cards, and cards that cross currencies and regions – the complexity of managing them increases. Processing technologies are having a difficult time keeping legacy systems up to the task of accommodating this new wave of innovative projects – that’s where we come in.</p>

<p>JG: Okay, what would be an example of something a legacy system couldn’t handle that SPAN can do?</p>

<p>BB: Legacy systems were designed to authorize a transaction against a balance, that’s about it. Programs today demand flexibility to authorize transactions against a number of different balance types, be that a different currency, a loyalty balance, or even a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.</p>

<p>JG: Other than legacy systems that can’t accommodate current needs, are there larger trends you think will help SPAN?</p>

<p>BB: The traditional banking world as we know it is evolving; non-financial institutions are now taking on some of the, if not all, the functions that traditional banks offer. The big five technology providers – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook – are chipping away at the traditional functions of banks and FinTech companies are revolutionizing banking services, especially payments.</p>

<p>Another trend we noticed is telecom carriers getting into the financial services space. One good example of this is T-Mobile launching their own banking and prepaid program, as well as Orange launching their own banking service this year. So as far as our industry focus is concerned, one of the primary markets is telecom providers and enabling them to easily launch prepaid products and other financial services like remittance.</p>

<p>JG: And how will this create opportunities for Tern Commerce or other businesses like you?</p>

<p>BB: This market is a global opportunity and one with a changing landscape. There are more mobile phones in the world today than there are people, so programs need to accommodate this growing “mobile-first” mentality. There are many processors and technology providers focused on specific geographic markets, offering physical cards to be used in a specific country. SPAN is globally focused, tech and mobile forward, and we support a growing list of integrated third-party partners. These global partners include identity verification providers as well as partners we rely on to “load” or “top up” funds on to our cards. Our team has engineered our platform to support both physical and virtual cards and we are actively working on our own authorization engine for clients looking to launch stored-value closed-loop solutions. Visa and Mastercard are evolving too and looking for ways to grow their brands globally and cross-border, SPAN can be seen as a catalyst for this expansion.</p>

<p>JG: So, what exactly is your platform?</p>

<p>BB: SPAN is a SAAS solution for program managers and stored value facilities. At its core, it is a robust fraud and risk mitigation solution which has been fine-tuned for years, thanks to US Unlocked. As a cross-border global prepaid program operating in over 100 countries, US Unlocked became very good at combating bad players, risky transactions, and increasingly crafty fraudsters.</p>

<p>Tern still operates the US Unlocked consumer-facing card program which also served as the beta customer for the SPAN platform. To explain why US Unlocked’s original platform is so significant to SPAN, let’s start with a use case.</p>

<p>US products are attractive to many in the rest of the world. US Unlocked addressed this market by offering a platform to onboard international customers, track their purchases and transactions against an approved merchant list, and to ensure there is no fraud or bad parties in the ecosystem. US Unlocked accommodates loading virtual accounts as well as the necessary identity verification of all the parties in the platform. In addition to a technology platform, US Unlocked had fine-tuned the process for managing an international card program that is prone to attracting risk and fraud.</p>

<p>When Tern took over US Unlocked and started to develop SPAN, we took all of the existing tools, processes, and controls and enhanced them.</p>

<p>With SPAN, we provide technology solutions for the prepaid industry on a global scale. Our platform is a good fit for new prepaid programs that wants to get up and running quickly with a consumer portal, native apps, back-office tools and CRM functions to help grow.</p>

<p>SPAN is also well suited to address the needs of programs with users across-borders with requirements around multi-currency, remittance, and cross-border shopping.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have a number of clients looking to use the SPAN platform for stored value programs both in the private and public sectors. All our clients have similar needs addressed by the core functions of SPAN: getting people identified and boarded; loading money into the platform; getting money out of the platform; and managing users and their transactions.</p>

<p>That is SPAN in a nutshell – basically an out-of-the-box program management solution with global capabilities.</p>

<p>JG: Out-of-the-box sounds good; what does SPAN actually supply?</p>

<p>BB: Our focus is to make our core functions accessible via API and mobile, to support a multi-tier program/account/brand infrastructure, and to support marketing distribution with agent and affiliate management tools.</p>

<p>On the consumer side, it’s card enrollment, card issuance, card management, and card loading. On the back-office platform side, included is a program management dashboard with fee and revenue calculation across multiple programs, agents, and discounts. Because of the integrated fraud and risk mitigation solution, program managers don’t need to worry about the KYC, AML, and regulatory environments – which is increasingly important as prepaid programs fall under increased regulatory scrutiny.</p>

<p>JG: Got you. Can you walk me through the experience of using your products today? What exactly am I going to get when I use SPAN?</p>

<p>BB: Sure. Let’s keep it very simple: you are looking to launch a prepaid program.</p>

<p>First, you will need to find a technology processor, a bank issuer, and a network to launch your program. This is mostly a process of negotiating and underwriting where you will need to demonstrate a technology platform for your staff to manage the card operation and a web-based portal for your consumers to manager cards.</p>

<p>That is where we come in by providing an end-to-end solution out of the box, which can be deployed in a matter of weeks.</p>

<p>We work with several processors, issuers and program managers and are happy to make appropriate introductions if needed. If you already have a processor and program manager and we are not integrated to them yet, we can very easily add them to our platform. If you were looking to launch an international program we would use our networks of international banks, and if looking for a cross-border solution, it may involve two banks in two different geographies. We can support all of these use cases today.</p>

<p>JG: That sounds great. But what are the challenges?</p>

<p>BB: Our biggest challenge is accommodating changing regulation as well as updated rules and pricing by the major networks on a global scale. Add to this an increasing threat of seasoned fraudsters trying to attack every element of the payment ecosystem. We definitely have our hands full.</p>

<p>JG: Yeah, that makes sense, given the global aspect that you’ve been discussing. We’ve all seen where fraud numbers are going. So what’s next for SPAN? Do you have any upcoming milestones or announcements?</p>

<p>BB: We are pleased to announce we have successfully completed our beta launch and are releasing the SPAN platform as a SAAS solution publicly in December 2017. This first release includes flexible multi-currency, multi-language functionality to quickly launch domestic, international, and cross-border card programs. For 2018, SPAN will be launching native apps for our clients to easily launch mobile programs as well as a flexible, real-time, closed-loop authorization engine.</p>

<p>After that, we will start to deploy a growing suite of banking services through our platform available online and through our mobile app. Just last week, RBS announced they are closing 25% of their branches, and this trend will continue as more people the world over turn to their mobile phones, rather than traditional branches, for banking. Our long-term vision is to provide a host mobile banking solutions deployed through our partner channels.</p>

<p>As of now, we are ready to onboard new customers, partners, and service providers.</p>

<p>JG: All right. So if someone wanted to be on your platform, what would they need to do to get started?</p>

<p>BB: I would recommend interested parties contact us for a demo and request access to our API docs. From there, one of our solution folks will review their go-to-market strategy and identify what elements SPAN can assist. If the customer already has an app or a portal or a consumer-facing platform, we would either work with them to integrate our APIs or put our heads together on how to provide the best consumer experience with SSO.</p>

<p>JG: Got you. And do you have any closing thoughts or anything that you want people to know about where your SPAN platform is today?</p>

<p>BB: I think we are just scratching the surface of the capabilities and market opportunity of SPAN. We consider ourselves super fortunate to have built off the code and knowledge base of an incredibly successful and unique cross-border prepaid program, US Unlocked. Our team is excited about the SPAN platform and are focused on becoming the most advanced prepaid card management and stored-value solution on the planet. We encourage people to stay tuned to see what is next or reach out to us for a demo or a chat.</p>

<p>JG: All right, Brion thanks a lot for joining us today and I look forward to seeing the formal rollout of the SPAN.</p>

<p>Brion: You bet.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Governing authorities in the Middle East did not lose time in 2017, setting up innovation labs, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/international-fintech-regulatory-sandboxes-launched-by-forward-thinking-financial-authorities/">Sandboxes</a>, and establishing strategic partnerships with international institutions in order to turn the region into a nexus of FinTech innovation. Given that the emerging markets are expected to adopt innovation at a more accelerated pace than the developed world in 2018 and beyond, FinTech may become the new oil in the Middle East and North Africa.</p>

<h2 id="pick-1-fintech-is-the-new-oil-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa"><strong>Pick #1. FinTech Is The New Oil in The Middle East and North Africa</strong></h2>

<p>“In the Middle East, FinTech will emerge as one of the strongest sectors of the economy. Saudi Arabia’s 2030 vision, which aims to reduce the dependency on oil revenues and diversify the economy by empowering small and medium enterprises, has opened up more opportunities for FinTech.” – Al Jouf, Founder &amp; CEO of PayTabs, a Saudi-based payment processing startup. “FinTech’s penetration into Islamic finance is still in its nascent stage, however, it could help Islamic banks become more efficient and scale up their operations,” says Al Jouf. “Traditional banking as it is known today will disappear in few years’ time,” he adds.</p>

<p>“There’s a unanimous agreement that blockchain is going to have a massive impact on the FinTech space. The technology is trustworthy and allows transactions without any risk to either party,” says Yazin Alirhayim, Co-founder of Verify.</p>

<h2 id="pick-2-mastercard-assemble-kicks-off-with-a-product-geared-toward-the-money-management-needs-of-millennials"><strong>Pick #2. Mastercard Assemble kicks off with a product geared toward the money management needs of millennials</strong></h2>

<p>Prepaid is much more than just a way to safely store and use funds. It is a foundation to create new possibilities for consumers. This technology enables our partners to deliver best-in-class digital experiences today, as we work to address additional segments such as gig economy workers and underserved consumers and micro businesses.” – Tom Cronin, senior vice president, Global Prepaid Product Development and Innovation, Mastercard</p>

<p>Mastercard Assemble not only bundles assets and services together but also enables these digital prepaid solutions to promote innovation, increase the speed to market, and provide customers with seamless and secure usage. Issuers and partners can choose to deploy a white-label version of the solution or to integrate specific functions into their current user interfaces through APIs.</p>

<p>While Mastercard Assemble for Millennials will be the first launch, the company is currently developing additional use cases to support prepaid programs for additional segments such as underserved consumers and micro-businesses, and the gig economy. Mastercard Assemble for Millennials is available now in the United States with other markets being targeted within the next year.</p>

<h2 id="pick-3-vanguard-taps-symbionts-private-blockchain-for-index-fund-data"><strong>Pick #3. Vanguard Taps Symbiont’s Private Blockchain for Index Fund Data</strong></h2>

<p>Vanguard will begin using smart contract technology developed by blockchain startup Symbiont in some of its actual business processes starting early next year.</p>

<p>The companies have been testing the technology to simplify the way Vanguard takes in data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business. This information is used to determine the composition of certain index funds managed by Vanguard, and includes things like company names, share counts, index weighting and corporate actions such as mergers or stock splits.</p>

<p>The three partners found the private blockchain speeds up delivery of the data from CRSP to Vanguard, removes the need for manual intervention and lowers risk. The project will go into full production in early 2018.</p>

<p>The partnership will involve 17 index funds totaling $1.15 trillion in assets, including Vanguard’s largest, the $650 billion Total Stock Market Index fund.</p>

<h2 id="pick-4-deutsche-bank-debuts-robo-advisor-for-retail-market"><strong>Pick #4. Deutsche Bank debuts robo-advisor for retail market</strong></h2>

<p>After a soft launch last month, Deutsche Bank is now planning to make its robo-advisor Robin available through its branch network – a first in the German market. Commerzbank introduced a robo-advisor earlier this year through its online bank, Comdirect. Deutsche has more than 1,500 branches in Germany and is in the process of integrating the retail branch network of its Postbank subsidiary into the parent bank.</p>

<h2 id="pick-5-survival-of-the-fittest-regtechs-face-a-year-of-consolidation"><strong>Pick #5. Survival of the fittest: RegTechs face a year of consolidation</strong></h2>

<p>“Many advisers expect a surge in M&amp;A activity in 2018. They say banks, asset managers, stock exchanges and technology providers are all eyeing acquisitions. Regulation is top of mind for most financial institutions following the global financial crisis, and many City firms are now actively approaching RegTechs to acquire the tech and expertise. A lot of institutions have been in the firefighting mode but some banks will think more strategically and try to embed RegTech in their organizations.” – John Meehan, Partner at advisory boutique Arma Partners</p>

<p>For banks, these acquisitions could be a way of reducing their compliance bill (Citi, for example, has 40,000 people working in the compliance department). “Banks are going to be focused on reducing that number. Technology is the only solution,” he said.</p>

<p>Large corporates are queuing up to buy RegTech companies. They often move earlier than they normally would, as having the most updated technology is also becoming a real competitive advantage for them.</p>

<p>“If you see that consolidation is happening, there’s obviously a need to win because of the large number of RegTech solution providers out there. Only so many of those will be successful as the market shakes out. As people start to work with a number of suppliers you have to think strategically where your best bet lies in terms of scaling your business.” – Richard Maton, member of the founding team at Sybenetix (acquired by Nasdaq). This could be growing organically or as part of a larger organization that has a bigger reach.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>I had the pleasure of sitting down with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadeem-khan-34b0959/">Nadeem Khan</a>, President of Aflac Corporate Ventures (<a href="https://www.aflac.com/about-aflac/newsroom/press-release-story.aspx?rid=828">launched in March 2017</a>) in their newest office situated in the Packard Place building in downtown Charlotte, North Carolina. Nadeem leads Aflac Corporate Ventures including all operating and investment subsidiaries such as Empowered Benefits (acquired by Aflac) and Aflac Ventures. Prior to joining Aflac, he held various leadership positions with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Siemens, and Lucent Technologies. Nadeem holds a bachelor’s degree in commerce with a specialization in accounting &amp; economics as well as a master’s degree in business administration. He serves on the boards of TTV Capital, Better Business Bureau of Columbus, and other nonprofit organizations.</p>

<p>Designed to help the company enhance its strategic and innovative focus in both the US and Japan, Aflac Corporate Ventures partners with technology accelerators to create the agility required to quickly identify and invest in early-stage companies, helping them accelerate innovation across the insurance value chain, including digital solutions that enhance the customer experience.</p>

<p>Josh Goodman: Nadeem, thanks for joining us today. To start things off, can you tell us a little about yourself?</p>

<p>Nadeem Khan: While I spend a great deal of my time in Charlotte, I live in Columbus, Georgia, which is home to Aflac’s worldwide headquarters. I started my career with Aflac in 2004. Although my background is in technology, my career at Aflac has been very diverse. From an entrepreneur to a corporate employee, my twenty-plus-years career has been wholly gratifying and enlightening. I’ve been fortunate to be with amazing companies like Aflac, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Siemens, and Lucent Technologies. My exposure to a wide array of corporate cultures, people, and business sectors has broadened my perspective. I’ve learned the value of self-discipline – and I’ve gained enormous confidence that enables me to face challenges head-on. In my current role, I lead two companies: Empowered, which is Aflac’s digital innovation center here in Charlotte, and Aflac Ventures, a $100 million venture fund.</p>

<p>JG: So what exactly is Aflac Corporate Ventures and this venture fund?</p>

<p>NK: From an organizational standpoint, Aflac Corporate Ventures is an independent legal entity under Aflac Inc., our holding company. While this venture arm sits outside the insurance operations, the two organizations are closely and strategically aligned. Aflac Ventures and Empowered are two subsidiaries of Aflac Corporate Ventures.</p>

<p>This venture component came about organically – a natural extension of Aflac’s commitment to invest in innovation, both in the US and Japan. We focus on early-stage companies whose ideas and capabilities are relevant to Aflac’s core business. By taking direct ownership in these burgeoning companies, we can create something mutually beneficial: we form commercial alliances and exchange intellectual capital and research.</p>

<p>JG: Got you. And can you go into more detail about the main focus and key goals of the ventures you pursue?</p>

<p>NK: As I mentioned, we focus on early-stage companies that align with our core business. In the US, that’s the employee-driven voluntary insurance space. In Japan, it’s supplemental health markets. For both geographies, it includes alternative distribution.</p>

<p>We source opportunities – both in the US and Japan – through existing industry-driven contacts as well as financial/<a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/13-insurtech-accelerators-and-incubators-supercharging-insurance-industry/">insurance technology accelerators and incubation platforms</a>. In addition to direct investments, we invest indirectly by forming partnerships with third-party <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/83-fintech-vc-firms-to-consider-if-you-are-a-fintech-startup-raising-money/">VC funds</a> that have specific knowledge of insurance and Aflac’s strategic focus. In general, our investments will seek to leverage our global brand and core franchise position: ensuring one in every four households in Japan, and touching over 400,000 small businesses in the US.</p>

<p>JG: How do you deal with regulations when you’re dealing with all these startups and all this innovation?</p>

<p>NK: As you know, insurance is a highly regulated industry. We work very closely with our internal compliance department and regulators to stay in lock step with ever-changing rules and regulations. The regulators are also interested in leveraging technology to simplify their processes. They want to prevent compliance bottlenecks, and they’re open to learning new ways of doing things to become more efficient. We also make sure our portfolio companies and startups are fully educated on current regulations – that way, we can be certain all new capabilities and solutions meet regulatory standards and requirements.</p>

<p>JG: That makes a lot of sense and obviously there’s a huge benefit to all of these early-stage companies getting that kind of feedback early on – so you don’t have to deal with that on the back-end. That also leads me to my next question – and this may be a little redundant – what is Aflac’s approach to innovation?</p>

<p>NK: Aflac has always been known as an innovative company. We want to stay that way by continually finding ways of doing things better, cheaper, and faster. By incubating and leveraging the capabilities of Aflac Ventures portfolio companies, we’ll empower <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/101-insurtech-startups-revolutionizing-the-4-5-trillion-dollar-insurance-industry/">digitally-native insurance operations</a> to be perpetually innovative and relevant. We want to persistently ask the question, “What if?” We want to push beyond perceived limits and imagine entirely new possibilities in the world of healthcare, insurance and beyond. Our collective team has the creativity, experience, and skill to create new tech solutions that benefit our customers, our distributors, our employees, and our communities.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Afl.png" alt="Afl.png" /></p>

<p>JG: What is the biggest challenge facing InsurTech right now?</p>

<p>NK: Right now, the pace of technology is out of sync with regulatory changes. The regulators are showing interest and signs of change, but again, they’re not at the same pace with changes coming in technology.</p>

<p>JG: I can only imagine.</p>

<p>NK: Exactly. When you’re working with 50 state regulators, you may have two or three states that are very open and adaptable to new and innovative ways. But then there are 47 other regulators that have to get onboard. So I’m hopeful regulations will become less complex and more accommodating to tech innovation.</p>

<p>JG: Yes, I imagine you’re not alone in that sentiment.</p>

<p>NK: Everybody faces that same challenge. And it’s beyond insurance, I would say.</p>

<p>JG: So, we’re sitting in this lovely office in Charlotte, and being a native of Charlotte, I have to ask, why Charlotte? What brought you guys here?</p>

<p>NK: Not everyone realizes <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/investing-in-the-southeast-a-growing-fintech-hub/">Charlotte is a thriving hub for innovation and technology</a>. There’s a very diversified workforce here that drives innovation across many industries; and our community and city leaders support entrepreneurialism through a range of accelerator and incubator programs. Just recently, Inc.com named Charlotte the No. 2 city of “Four Cities You Didn’t Know Were Startup Hotbeds.” Here in the Queen City, we have access to an enthusiastic and growing community of innovators. It’s the ideal location to create and grow our digital innovations.</p>

<p>JG: So what’s next for Aflac Corporate Ventures and Empowered? Are there any upcoming milestones or anything that we should know about?</p>

<p>NK: I can hardly contain my excitement about the milestones that lie ahead for us. We’re in the process of developing truly disruptive digital technology that will open up new possibilities across the industry spectrum. Aflac Ventures creates new opportunities for early-stage companies, then Empowered takes the groundbreaking ideas and develop them into functional, marketable solutions. It’s a win for Aflac, a win for us, and a win for Charlotte.</p>

<p>JG: All right, well, thanks a lot Nadeem, it’s been a pleasure.</p>

<p>NK: The pleasure’s mine. Thank you so much.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>As <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/daily-review-technology-companies-invading-financial-world/">technology companies are gradually invading the financial world</a>, the circle tightens up around the most expected step – fully-fledged banking services from the likes of Amazon. The year 2018 will reveal startups to be a healthy push to innovation adoption rather than any substantial competition, while <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/fintech-not-threat-to-banks-telcos-whatsapps-and-amazons-of-the-world-are/">Telcos, WhatsApps, Amazons of the world increase the pressure in already actively transforming financial services industry</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pick-1-will-2018-be-the-year-of-the-bank-of-amazon-experts-weigh-in">Pick #1. Will 2018 Be the Year of the Bank of Amazon? Experts Weigh In</h2>

<p>Retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. have long wanted in on banking, and regulators might finally be on their side. That could open the door to a Bank of Amazon or a Facebook Financial. If these technology giants did decide to move into finance, they would have a few major advantages over the banks: better data, a superior user experience, and immense customer loyalty.</p>

<p>“The tech behemoths have been slow-ish but that’s changing quickly driven largely by Chinese chat/payments envy. Facebook, Apple and others will double down on trying to replicate this in the US.” – Jeremy Philips, Spark Capital</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-12/will-2018-be-the-year-of-the-bank-of-amazon-experts-weigh-in?cmpId=flipboard">Read more</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pick-2-2018-another-growth-year-for-blockchain">Pick #2. 2018: Another Growth Year for Blockchain</h2>

<h3 id="on-payments">On payments</h3>

<p>As we saw payments do in 2017, I expect we will see trade finance begin to go live on blockchain in 2018. In payments, momentum will pick up and volumes will increase as larger banks, including correspondent banks, get into the act. These players will be tempted by the advantages blockchain brings in terms of real-time processing, lower risk profiles, lower costs, and transparency.</p>

<h3 id="on-the-fund-industry">On the fund industry</h3>

<p>One space I think we should keep a particular eye on in 2018 is the fund industry, where firms like Melonport are using blockchain to rethink asset management. I think we will see more of this, and that the fund industry will start to be significantly disrupted next year.</p>

<p>This will start with the management of crypto-assets, but over time, we will see traditional assets increasingly being tokenized, migrated onto blockchains and managed on-chain.</p>

<h3 id="on-icos">On ICOs</h3>

<p>Over the next 12-18 months, I expect people with experience and expertise in the IPO world will embrace tokenization as a technical platform, and the whole business will be professionalized, with book building, pricing, startup evaluation and so on happening more along traditional lines.</p>

<p>As we’ve already begun to see, it will be harder to get funding simply on the back of a white paper. Investors will demand sound business plans and high levels of transparency, with all that entails.</p>

<h2 id="pick-3-the-internet-of-things-past-present-and-future">Pick #3. The Internet of Things: Past, present, and future</h2>

<p>IoT adoption of is driving the growth of sensor technology. The rise of big data and the pressures around proficiencies and productivity has led more businesses to explore the concept of sensor-enabled machinery. Referred to as “indispensable and integral in digital ecosystems,” using smart sensors in a factory setting means that problems, or predicted problems, can be proactively identified and dealt with automatically – even down to component level – minimizing downtime and boosting productivity.</p>

<p>Smart buildings are becoming one of the most recognizable applications of IoT. Sensors can be used to turn off lights when the last person leaves at night, and turn them back on when the first person arrives the next morning. They can control heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and analyze the data they collect to determine the most efficient means of lighting or heating a space.</p>

<p>We’re also seeing more integration of sensors into everyday objects, such as electricity meters, waste bins, traffic lights and street lights, which is steering society towards a smarter way of living. There’s more talk of the likes of driverless cars, a key takeaway from the recent UK Budget announcement, which is set to transform how we live everyday life and take us one step further into a society revolved around the latest technologies.</p>

<p>“A big part of the Internet of Things isn’t so much about smart devices, but about sensors. These tiny innovations can be attached to everything from yogurt cups to the cement in bridges and then record and send data back into the cloud. This will allow businesses to collect more and more specific feedback on how products or equipment are used, when they break, and even what users might want in the future.” – Bernard Marr, Forbes</p>

<h2 id="pick-4-indiegogo-goes-where-few-companies-dare-into-initial-coin-offerings">Pick #4. Indiegogo Goes Where Few Companies Dare: Into Initial Coin Offerings</h2>

<p>Indiegogo helped take crowdfunding mainstream. Now the company is hoping it can do the same for initial coin offerings, the popular but unregulated practice of selling custom virtual currencies to raise money for software projects.</p>

<p>Indiegogo started a new service on Tuesday to vet coin offerings, and then help sell them to small and large investors.</p>

<p>The first project to use the service – a startup known as the <a href="https://fcfl.io/">Fan-Controlled Football League</a> will begin raising $5 million on Indiegogo this week. The startup aims to use the money to create a league of football teams that will be guided by people who buy the league’s coins (a crazy-sounding idea that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/sports/football/indoor-football-league-screaming-eagles.html?_r=0">has already been tested</a>).</p>

<p>“We want to bring a brand of trust to the entire industry, which we think will bring ICOs to the mainstream,” said Slava Rubin, one of the founders of Indiegogo.</p>

<h2 id="pick-5-kicking-off-stripes-private-beta-in-india">Pick #5. Kicking off Stripe’s private beta in India</h2>

<p>“Today, we’re starting an invite-only beta for Stripe in India with a small group of companies. These businesses will help us test our platform in the Indian market and provide feedback on features that we’ll need to build to support all Indian businesses looking to accept online payments and run their companies on Stripe.</p>

<p>Supporting Indian entrepreneurs is critical to our mission of expanding the GDP of the internet. Now more than ever, India is uniquely positioned to move more commerce online: In just the past two years, the percentage of India’s population connected to the internet has more than doubled to 500 million users. And in 2016, India saw more than twice the number of new businesses start as the United States.</p>

<p>With Stripe Atlas, we’ve already been able to help some Indian entrepreneurs build and scale global companies. However, we believe that by operating locally in India – with the ability for Indian companies to connect their local bank accounts to Stripe and get paid out in rupees – we can help support even more businesses and more types of business models (such as local marketplaces) in the years to come.” – Anand Balaji, India Lead, Stripe</p>

                    <p>It was a big year for <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/10-fintech-predictions-for-asia-in-2017/">FinTech in 2017</a> – and 2018 is shaping up to be every bit as exciting. Here are some FinTech predictions for 2018:</p>

<h2 id="1-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies--here-come-the-institutional-investors">1. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies – here come the institutional investors?</h2>

<p>Many records were broken in 2017 by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Not only did they achieve record high prices, they also generated a lot of public awareness and interest. Expect this to continue in 2018, with potential institutional investors announcing crypto investments or launching crypto funds, plus some of the “incumbent” service providers, from brokers to banks, entering the space.</p>

<p>Look out for many new innovations in the retail space as well. Despite the numerous ground-breaking features of cryptocurrencies or ICOs, investing in them is still not very user-friendly. And the safekeeping of private keys requires even more experience. For example, while you can always regain access to your bank account if you lose your bank’s PIN, your crypto-assets are lost forever if you lose your private keys!</p>

<h2 id="2-crypto-regulations-and-tax--are-the-regulators-and-tax-authorities-set-to-join-the-party-as-well">2. Crypto regulations and tax – are the regulators and tax authorities set to join the party as well?</h2>

<p>Many regulators have taken a balanced and practical approach to cryptocurrencies so far. But they have made it clear that they will crack down on any violations, with the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-131">SEC’s investigative report on the DAO</a> being a good example. However, more high-profile enforcement cases against reckless ICOs look set to take place, with regulators seeking to make examples of some of the bad apples for the rest of the industry.</p>

<p>Expect the tax authorities to be more active, too, especially with the rise in the price of Bitcoin. The recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/29/coinbase-internal-revenue-service-taxation/">IRS request</a> for the names of account holders at one of the large US crypto exchanges may be an indication of things to come.</p>

<h2 id="3-icos--is-the-child-becoming-a-teenager">3. ICOs – is the child becoming a teenager?</h2>

<p>ICOs generated a lot of media attention in the past year with more than USD $3 billion raised via such token sales and the industry evolving fairly quickly from a “two guys and a white paper” model to one of the experienced teams advised by professional firms with well-thought-through business models.</p>

<p>While the ICO frenzy may calm down in 2018, especially in terms of the number of ICOS and the amounts raised, expect the industry to further institutionalize with the further development of best practices. This will be seen especially in key areas from KYC and AML processes to governance and transparency standards. Expect more industry best-practice initiatives to take place, too – the recent one from the Hong Kong FinTech Association being a good<a href="http://hkfintech.org/token-sale-paper/">example</a>.</p>

<h2 id="4-regtech--a-wave-of-consolidation-ahead">4. RegTech – a wave of consolidation ahead?</h2>

<p>Regulatory technology (RegTech) will continue to be highly interesting to financial institutions looking not only to deal with their regulatory obligations more effectively and efficiently but also to reduce the risks and costs associated with such functions.</p>

<p>However, the long sales cycles and the procurement obstacles will remain a challenge, especially as legal and compliance teams are often relatively unfamiliar with RegTech. In addition, the lack of dominant players in this space will cause further consolidations in the industry, with RegTech startups likely being acquired by some of the traditional technology providers who don’t want to be left behind.</p>

<h2 id="5-banks-embracing-fintech--the-end-of-innovation-teams">5. Banks embracing FinTech – the end of innovation teams?</h2>

<p>Although innovation teams played a crucial role in the early days of FinTech, when banks and startups were learning how to work together, many were often criticized for lacking budget and serving more as a marketing tool than acting as drivers of meaningful change inside the organization.</p>

<p>With the increased familiarity and understanding of FinTech by banks’ senior management, expect many FinTechs to avoid innovation teams altogether and deal with the relevant business lines directly. As well as saving FinTech startups’ time and energy, this will continue to embed innovation as a mindset across the organization rather than having it limited to just the innovation team. Easier said than done!</p>

<h2 id="6-suptech--say-hello-to-your-new-tech-driven-regulator">6. SupTech – say hello to your new tech-driven regulator?</h2>

<p>Supervisory Technology, SupTech for short, is the use of new technology by regulators to make their supervision more effective and the compliance burden imposed less painful. Contrary to what some may think, many regulators are already experimenting with advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence tools – not only to detect market manipulation but to process the thousands of regulatory filings received each month.</p>

<p>Expect some of the leading regulators to continue to act as pioneers in this space. For example, the <a href="http://www.mas.gov.sg/News-and-Publications/Speeches-and-Monetary-Policy-Statements/Speeches/2017/Singapore-FinTech-Journey-2.aspx">Monetary Authority of Singapore</a> is looking to use machine-readable templates for regulatory reporting, as well as completely revamping its data-collection exercises – even allowing financial institutions to turn down the regulator’s request if it asks for the same data twice.</p>

<h2 id="7-open-banking--aggregating-your-banking-data-with-your-favorite-tech-firm">7. Open Banking – aggregating your banking data with your favorite tech firm?</h2>

<p>Discussions around open banking and the opening of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) will continue to be at the top of the FinTech agenda in 2018, powered by regulatory initiatives such as PSD2 in Europe or the Open API framework <a href="http://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/key-information/press-releases/2017/20170929-3.shtml">announced</a> by the Hong Kong regulators.</p>

<p>While most agree that open banking is the general path that the industry is heading towards, it will be interesting to see how incumbent banks try to position themselves in 2018 and what advances large tech firms will make. In an open banking model, will consumers trust a tech firm as their main interface or their traditional bank? The jury is still out.</p>

<h2 id="8-voice-as-a-user-interface--is-alexa-your-new-banker">8. Voice as a user interface – is Alexa your new banker?</h2>

<p>Although the focus is still on mobile first, voice as a user interface is becoming increasingly accepted and available. Voice-enabled assistants – from Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home in the West to Baidu’s Xiaoyu and Alibaba’s Genie in Asia – are increasingly becoming part of our everyday lives, with some studies even predicting that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/08/voice-enabled-smart-speakers-to-reach-55-of-u-s-households-by-2022-says-report/">majority of US households will have one by 2022</a>.</p>

<p>As was the case with chatbots in recent years, expect financial institutions to continue experimenting with how they can integrate such solutions into their offerings to customers. While there are still a number of data security and privacy issues, this is an area that looks promising. So could Alexa be your new banker?</p>

<h2 id="9-fintech-arbitrage--build-in-the-west-and-sell-in-the-east">9. FinTech arbitrage – build in the West and sell in the East?</h2>

<p>Asia is generally recognized as the global leader in B2C FinTech – mainly due to the advances that the large Chinese BATs (Baidu, Ant Financial, Tencent) have been making in how they deliver financial services to the public. But Asia is also continuing to emerge as a B2B FinTech leader, not necessarily from an innovation perspective but rather in terms of adoption and integration.</p>

<p>Financial institutions in Asia are generally very eager to try new solutions due to the relatively tech-savvy and demanding nature of their client base. Most financial institutions, as well as the Asia divisions of large international banks, now have reasonable autonomy with regard to what innovations they can bring onboard. And this may be an opportunity for B2B-focused FinTech firms around the world to develop their R&amp;D in the West and deploy them in Asia, using places such as Hong Kong or Singapore as stepping stones.</p>

<h2 id="10-fraud-and-cybersecurity--avoiding-bad-apples-and-black-swans">10. Fraud and cybersecurity – avoiding bad apples and Black Swans?</h2>

<p>The FinTech industry is continuing to grow despite numerous hurdles. The biggest challenge could be a major incident, such as a cyberattack in which sensitive consumer data risks being stolen. Or a flagrant fraud case that could seriously undermine the goodwill the banks and the public at large have towards FinTechs. The Bitcoin ecosystem, for example, had a major setback following the 2014 Mt. Gox scandal, which slowed its momentum. And the P2P lending space was severely tainted by multiple scandals and Ponzi schemes in recent years. More recently, cyber-attacks on banks have not only continued but have targeted young ICOs that may have less secure infrastructures.</p>

<p>For the broader FinTech industry to continue to prosper, it will be important to ensure that everyone is operating at an institutional-grade level of professionalism, integrity &amp; transparency, and to take the appropriate precautions to avoid any unforeseen events (as far as possible!).</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>There are currently between 2.9 million and 5.8 million unique users actively using a cryptocurrency wallet, according to a <a href="https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/research/centres/alternative-finance/downloads/2017-global-cryptocurrency-benchmarking-study.pdf">study</a> performed by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. Despite the accelerating scale of adoption and hype, Deutsche Bank deems cryptocurrencies as risky investments in its recent report, while extending its circle of trust to the underlying technology – blockchain.</p>

<h2 id="pick-1-cryptocurrencies-and-blockchains--their-importance-in-the-future--report-by-deutsche-bank">Pick #1. Cryptocurrencies and blockchains – their importance in the future – Report by Deutsche Bank</h2>

<h3 id="on-cryptocurrencies">On cryptocurrencies</h3>

<p>We rank cryptocurrencies as a risky investment because recent price increases are in part based on speculation. Volatility is very high and reached 80%; the whole sector is generally unregulated.</p>

<p>A benefit only arises because of their use as a medium of exchange for transactions. On one hand, their value rises as their use as a medium of exchange becomes more popular; on the other hand, cryptocurrencies are supported by their issue limitation compared to rising demand.</p>

<p>In some countries, the first certificates and funds based on cryptocurrencies have been launched. Also, CME Group plans to introduce future contracts. The government in Dubai officially announced their own cryptocurrency called emCash, which is used for government transactions but also for daily payments. After Japan allowed Bitcoins as a legal payment method, they also allowed eleven companies to trade Bitcoins.</p>

<h3 id="on-blockchain">On blockchain</h3>

<p><img src="/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-11%20at%209.25.23%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2017-12-11 at 9.25.23 PM.png" /></p>

<p>We expect that the blockchain will change the business model of companies in a sustained way. Blockchain technology enables a faster and cheaper exchange of assets and financial products between individuals without an intermediate, which reduces the asymmetry of information between the individuals.</p>

<p>About 63% of the managers from German banks expect a change in their business model in the next 10 years because of blockchain technologies. About 29% of the respondents expect financial advantages, while 50% of the respondents stayed neutral towards blockchains. But 76% of the respondents will plan to implement the blockchain in their business model after they have seen a successful implementation by other market participants.</p>

<h2 id="pick-2-wireless-technology-without-batteries-this-startup-is-powering-iot-devices--using-air">Pick #2. Wireless technology without batteries? This startup is powering IoT devices – using air!</h2>

<p>If you have something electric, you would need to power it with some source of energy. It can be a battery, electricity, fuel, or renewable sources of energy like sun, wind or water. Air certainly does not figure in the list, but Jeeva Wireless does just that. Equipped with antennas, this chip reflects and absorbs (or backscatters) existing radio waves and TV signals, transforming them into both a source of power and a communication medium. Unlike wireless setups available in the market today, it does not generate its own signals and simply leverages existing ones – making it ridiculously power-efficient in the process.</p>

<p>“Two objects equipped with this chip can interact with each other by harvesting ambient TV and cellular transmissions. In fact, Jeeva will be developing an extremely cheap connectivity solution using a flexible sticker form factor which can easily be integrated into everyday objects, thus enabling the vision of ubiquitous connectivity,” says Vamsi Talla, Co-founder &amp; CTO of Seattle-based startup, Jeeva Wireless.</p>

<p>These sensors can be inserted into anything, anywhere at very low costs. Moreover, since these devices have no batteries, they last indefinitely and require no maintenance at all, potentially enabling smart cities.</p>

<h2 id="pick-3-unionpay-takes-mobile-payment-services-fight-to-alibaba-and-tencent-with-integrated-app">Pick #3. UnionPay takes mobile payment services fight to Alibaba and Tencent with integrated app</h2>

<p>China UnionPay has created an integrated mobile app that facilitates nearly all mainland banks to expand mobile payment services, spurring a strong fightback against third-party payment services backed by Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings.</p>

<p>“Before the digital era, all payments went through the UnionPay system with banks and UnionPay splitting the transaction fees paid by merchants. But Alipay and Tenpay have bypassed UnionPay, connecting consumers and banks directly.” – Ba Shusong, Chief Economist at the China Banking Association. As a result, UnionPay has had to find a new role in the digital payments era.</p>

<p>The efforts include a partnership with JD.com in August, which recognized Chinabank Payments, the payment app backed by JD. This was the first time UnionPay had given access to an internet company’s third-party payments system.</p>

<p>“The QuickPass app, created under the guidance of the central bank, is a unified platform that utilizes all resources by commercial banks to offer users access to mobile payment.” – UnionPay</p>

<p>The facial recognition technology used in payment is in the works. The app could be linked to more than one bank account by different banks with all of their mobile payment services accepted and conducted via the platform.</p>

<h2 id="pick-4-spotlight-malaysia-sees-mobile-commerce-boom-as-mobile-payments-become-widely-available">Pick #4. Spotlight: Malaysia sees mobile commerce boom as mobile payments become widely available</h2>

<p>There are 42.8 million mobile phone subscriptions in Malaysia currently. Meanwhile, smartphone penetration stands at 70% and it is expected to increase.</p>

<p>Two major Chinese online payment companies – Alipay and WeChat Pay – making their ways into Malaysia e-payment segment could potentially double the online transactions.</p>

<p>There is also great potential for WeChat Pay, which will be unveiled in Malaysia next year, as it has 20 million WeChat holders in Malaysia and 600 million active users in China. Earlier this year, Alipay, a unit of Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, has inked agreements with Malaysian banks for the rollout of its service this year.</p>

<h2 id="pick-5-ai-in-storytelling-machines-as-co-creators">Pick #5. AI in storytelling: Machines as co-creators</h2>

<p><a href="http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/ai-emotional-arcs-mit-mckinsey-1202635570/">A team of MIT scientists taught an AI to get emotional over movies</a>. The researchers, which collaborated on this project with McKinsey, used machine learning to analyze thousands of videos including movies, TV shows and short films found on Vimeo, shared Silicon Valley correspondent Janko Roettgers.</p>

<p>“We developed machine-learning models that rely on deep neural networks to ‘watch’ small slices of video—movies, TV, and short online features—and estimate their positive or negative emotional content by the second.”</p>

<p>Just by analyzing the visual elements of a movie, the algorithms could detect where the tear jerkers would be, and how the overall emotional arc of a story would develop. Researchers also used a control group of human volunteers to map out their response to some of the movies analyzed by computers and then used that data to refine their models.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <h2><b>After many NFC pilots and Apple Pay, Samsung seems to have cracked the code!</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many in the contactless payments industry, they have had a genuine conviction each of the past 15 years: “</span><b>THIS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the year of NFC!” Well, we are not sure if this year has been the year of NFC yet, and we are not willing to bet too much on whether 2018 will be one either. However, we are definitely seeing encouraging signs of maturity and collaboration in the contactless payments ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, the success of any consumer-focused solution largely depends on the sheer superiority of the technology under the hood, among other factors. In the case of Samsung Pay, there’s even more that is contributing to its success so far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samsung Pay was born as a result of Samsung's</span><a href="https://www.looppay.com/wp-content/uploads/2015-02-18_Samsung_LoopPay.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">acquisition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of</span><a href="https://www.looppay.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">LoopPay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – over</span><a href="https://www.looppay.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">10 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> merchants were able to accept Loop wallet – at the end of 2014 when Apple Pay was announced and launched, it was already 40 times more than what Apple Pay could claim). LoopPay was a US-based mobile payment developer and service provider, based in Boston and founded by veterans of the industry, Will Wang Graylin, and Damien Balsan. Following the landmark deal, Samsung launched Samsung Pay in South Korea and the USA in 2015 with Loop technology embedded in the overall solution.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-28632 alignleft" src="/uploads/2017/12/sam1.png" alt="Samsung Pay: The Third Time’s a Charm" width="178" height="178" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="wp-image-28633 aligncenter" src="/uploads/2017/12/sam2.png" alt="Samsung Pay: The Third Time’s a Charm" width="425" height="140" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This acquisition accelerates our vision to drive and lead innovation in the world of mobile commerce. Our goal has always been to build the smartest, most secure, user-friendly mobile wallet experience and we are delighted to welcome LoopPay to take us closer to this goal,”</span><a href="https://www.looppay.com/wp-content/uploads/2015-02-18_Samsung_LoopPay.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jong-Kyun Shin, President &amp; Head of IT and Mobile Division at Samsung Electronics, announcing the deal in February 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The very strategic choice that led to the acquisition of LoopPay had a profound impact on the not so distant future of Samsung Pay: because merchants don’t need to update their POS terminals to include NFC capabilities, Samsung removed the technological friction for contactless payments adoption – existing magnetic stripe readers could accept payments from Samsung Pay digital wallets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, Samsung Pay added 10 new markets and introduced multiple new features. Among the advantageous hallmarks of Samsung Pay is its compatibility not only with payment terminals supporting NFC technology, relied on by most mobile wallets such as Apple Pay and Android Pay (previously Google Pay), but also with the ones with magnetic stripe card readers. Samsung Pay can be accepted almost everywhere, wherever cards are accepted – an advantage that allows Samsung Pay to move faster than its competitors can.</span></p>
<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28634" src="/uploads/2017/12/sam3.jpg" alt="Samsung Pay: The Third Time’s a Charm" width="1440" height="760" /></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Image source: Samsung</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samsung Pay owes this critical advantage to LoopPay’s patented Magnetic Secure Transmission™ (MST) technology, which turns in-store payment terminals where customers normally swipe a credit card into contactless readers.</span></p>
<h2><b>Competition is yesterday’s news. Samsung builds the future of deep integration and collaborative growth.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LoopPay, the innovation on which Samsung Pay is built, is the only solution that stores thousands of credit and debit cards from all banks and issuers – no matter how large or small – along with gift, loyalty, and private label cards from Starbucks and Target to Walmart, Macy’s and more. Furthermore, users can add their driver’s license, work, gym, or big box store IDs, reward cards for anything from drug stores, to coffee shops, as well as library cards and insurance cards. Plus, there is a Lockbox feature where users can safely store passwords and other critical information they may need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samsung Pay works in-store, in-app, and online. The parent company built an extraordinarily thought-through ecosystem for its solution and seamlessly integrated the acquired company’s assets. The</span><a href="https://www.samsungrewards.com/rewards/#/main"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Samsung Rewards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program allows users to earn points for every purchase with Samsung Pay, and use them to redeem rewards. Accumulating points, users can spend their way to Gear VR with a headset. Moreover, the more transactions that users make per month, the more points they can earn on every purchase.</span></p>
<h2><img class="wp-image-28635 alignleft" src="/uploads/2017/12/sam4.png" alt="Samsung Pay: The Third Time’s a Charm" width="294" height="166" /></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28636" src="/uploads/2017/12/sam5.png" alt="Samsung Pay: The Third Time’s a Charm" width="478" height="183" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, Samsung built an extensive ecosystem for its payment solution with banks &amp; issuers, gift card merchants, and in-app partners (Theme Store, Exxon Mobil Speedpass+, Raise, Galaxy Apps, Fancy, Shop Samsung, Samsung Cloud, etc.). This collaborative approach is necessary for any multi-sided proposition such as payments, but it is critical for a new modality to take off in consumer adoption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samsung Pay has partnered with American Express, Visa, and MasterCard payment card networks in conjunction with top US banks – 1313 financial institutions (banks and credit unions), to be exact, among which are Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo, Citi, Capital One, US Bank, PNC, USAA, TD Bank, Synchrony Bank, SunTrust, BB&amp;T, Fifth Third Bank, BBVA Compass, and</span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/rediscovering-discover-the-network-of-networks/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Discover – a unique network of networks by itself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participating gift card merchants include 167 companies, among which are Amazon.com, eBay, some of the most successful clothing brands and retail chains, OfficeMax, XBOX, IHOP, Nintendo, Nike, Hulu, Hyatt, Sephora, Panda Express, and a lot more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28637" src="/uploads/2017/12/sam6.jpg" alt="Image source: Samsung" width="1204" height="600" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Image source: Samsung</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No company can successfully grow and expand across barriers operating a closed ecosystem, with the exception of Apple of course! And Samsung Pay is an example of how a technology icon is able to prosper and grow in a rapidly changing business environment, and shifting consumer behavior, by adopting what in 2015 was yet an unorthodox mindset – an open collaborative approach to innovation in the historically controlled ecosystem of payments. </span></p>
<h2><b>Security matters: Samsung Knox – Defense-grade security for an open world </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Apple Pay gets some credit for launching tokenization, Samsung Pay builds upon that out with focus on systemic security built into the mobile technology stack. The fraud protection provided by a user’s bank for credit and debit card carries over to Samsung Pay. Every transaction is authenticated by the user’s fingerprint, PIN number or iris scan. If the phone is lost or stolen, owners can remotely lock or erase their Samsung Pay account with the Find My Mobile feature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokenization creates a unique randomized set of numbers to be used at each new transaction, so the real card number is never used from the phone. This was a long overdue payment security innovation that digital wallets catalyzed since 2014.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/business/solutions/samsung-knox/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samsung Knox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology constantly monitors the phone to keep information safe. Card information is encrypted in a separate and secure data vault at all times. Anchored in the hardware, Samsung Knox is also integrated throughout the software layers to separate and segment data and constantly check the integrity of the device. These defense layers detect any tampering and ensure that the data is secure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is</span><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/business/solutions/samsung-knox/#org-about"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">why Samsung Knox is one of the most important hallmarks of Samsung Pay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://kp-cdn.samsungknox.com/5ef8fc5a58971c019a4b0fe6607b4585.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Knox</span></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;"> protects applications and data by strictly defining what each process is allowed to do and what data it can access. This allows Knox to separate, encrypt, and protect enterprise data within a managed container.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Periodic Kernel Measurement &amp; Real-time Kernel Protection work to constantly inspect the core software of the OS, the kernel. These checks ensure that requests to bypass device security are blocked and sensitive data is protected.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Knox leverages a processor architecture known as TrustZone, in which highly sensitive computations are isolated from the rest of the device’s operations, protecting enterprise data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">To prevent security measures from being bypassed or compromised, Knox uses Boot-time Protections backed by Hardware Root of Trust to verify the integrity of the device during the boot process.</span></li>

<h2><b>Going above and beyond: Adding intelligence to the IoT user interface</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/injong-rhee-1355a4/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Injong Rhee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CTO, EVP, Software and Services at Samsung Electronics Mobile Business Division,</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMoBzKD1puk"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">shared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his vision at Samsung Developer Conference 2017, which took place in San Francisco this October, “Samsung went through a remarkable journey in the past years, from a hardware manufacturer to a software powerhouse that creates tightly integrated software and hardware experiences. It's demonstrated by the success of Samsung Knox, Samsung Pay, and Bixby.” Rhee added that Bixby reached 10 million subscribers in just three months after launching in the US.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our journey has been accelerated by the emergence of this [Bixby] intelligence and the Internet of Things. But one of the problems with IoT is UI. Every device has a different UI. For the user to learn a new UI for every device is too much. The major challenge, then, is to provide a unified, easy to use, UI. I believe the solution to this is intelligence,” Rhee continues. The unique characteristic of Bixby is its ability to flatten the user interface (versus the trees of functions, to which devices are limited to, leading to an average user utilizing less than 10% of total functionality on their devices).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe Bixby’s cognitive tolerance, its comprehensiveness, and customization will form the principles of modern intelligent user interface design.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have been monitoring</span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/future-of-mobile-payments/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">mobile payments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/financial-tech-digital-wallets-innovative-approach-vs-security-concerns/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">digital wallets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and specifically the NFC</span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/is-offering-contactless-payments-worth-it/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">contactless payments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since the very beginning. Our enthusiastic</span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/?s=Apple+Pay"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">coverage of Apple Pay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at launch and our candid perspectives on the disappointment in Apple’s limited application of energy in growing the product is well documented. After almost a decade of our founder being intimately involved in mobile payments, we continue to be most optimistic about Samsung Pay and its adoption globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe </span><b>THE</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> year of NFC is near!</span> </span></p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worldwide revenues for big data and business analytics will grow from $130.1 billion in 2016 to more than $203 billion in 2020, at a CAGR of 11.7%, IDC </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/worldwide-revenues-for-big-data-and-business-analytics-will-surpass-200-billion-in-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. "The availability of data, a new generation of technology, and a cultural shift toward data-driven decision making continue to drive demand for big data and analytics technology and services," said </span><a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=PRF000388"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Vesset</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Group Vice President, Analytics and Information Management, IDC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Forbes</em> </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2017/01/20/6-predictions-for-the-203-billion-big-data-analytics-market/#7104a2ae2083"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that by the end of 2017, revenue growth from information-based products will double the rest of the product/service portfolio for one-third of Fortune 500 companies. Raw data and various value-added content will be bought and sold either via marketplaces or in bilateral transactions and enterprises will begin to develop methods for valuing their data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data monetization is expected to become a major source of revenues, the edition reports, as the world will create 180 zettabytes of data (or 180 trillion gigabytes) in 2025, up from less than 10 zettabytes in 2015, citing </span><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/08/05/iot-mid-year-update-from-idc-and-other-research-firms/#67bff501765f"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As data-rich organizations look for ways to leverage endless opportunities deep insights into customers provide, big data analytics finds a variety of other applications, among which are cost reduction, search for innovation avenues, launch new products/services, add revenue, transform business for the future, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research suggests that the applications that yield the most value are expense decrease – almost 50% of executives from Fortune 1000 companies report to have seen value as they started using big data to decrease expenses. 44% started using big data and have seen value in finding new innovation avenues. Interestingly, one of the most unsuccessful ways big data is applied is to establish a data-driven culture – over 40% of executives have started using big data, but have not seen any value. Similarly, 33% of executives have not seen value in using big data for increasing the speed of current efforts; around 27% have not seen value using big data to launch new products/services. </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source: </span></i><a href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/how-companies-say-theyre-using-big-data"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">HBR</span></i></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the executives who have </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/how-companies-are-using-big-data-and-analytics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shared significant impact of using big data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is Vince Campisi, Former COO at GE Digital, "I’ll give you one internal perspective and one external perspective. One is we are doing a lot in what we call enabling a digital thread—how you can connect innovation through engineering, manufacturing, and all the way out to servicing a product. And, within that, we’ve got a focus around a brilliant factory. So, take driving supply-chain optimization as an example. We’ve been able to take over 60 different silos of information related to direct-material purchasing, leverage analytics to look at new relationships and use machine learning to identify tremendous amounts of efficiency in how we procure direct materials that go into our product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"An external example is how we leverage analytics to really make assets perform better. We call it asset performance management. And we’re starting to enable digital industries, like a digital wind farm, where you can leverage analytics to help the machines optimize themselves. So you can help a power-generating provider who uses the same wind that’s come through and, by having the turbines pitch themselves properly and understand how they can optimize that level of wind, we’ve demonstrated the ability to produce up to 10 percent more production of energy off the same amount of wind. It’s an example of using analytics to help a customer generate more yield and more productivity out of their existing capital investment."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explaining the impact of big data analytics, Victor Nilson, SVP, Big Data, AT&amp;T, </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/how-companies-are-using-big-data-and-analytics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, "We always start with the customer experience. That’s what matters most. In our customer care centers now, we have a large number of very complex products. Even the simple products sometimes have very complex potential problems or solutions, so the workflow is very complex. So how do we simplify the process for both the customer-care agent and the customer at the same time, whenever there’s an interaction?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve used big data techniques to analyze all the different permutations to augment that experience to more quickly resolve or enhance a particular situation. We take the complexity out and turn it into something simple and actionable. Simultaneously, we can then analyze that data and then go back and say, “Are we optimizing the network proactively in this particular case?” So, we take the optimization not only for the customer care but also for the network, and then tie that together as well."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ZhongAn, for example, an online property insurance company, specializes in the </span><a href="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/h2vc/static/reports/innovators/2017/H2-Fintech-Innovators-2017.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">use of big data to automate underwriting and claims processes, design and tailor products, and create precision marketing campaigns and risk management strategies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IDC expects that large and very large companies (500+ employees) will be the primary driver of the big data and business analytics opportunity, generating revenues of more than $154 billion in 2020. However, SMBs will remain a significant contributor with nearly a quarter of the worldwide revenues coming from companies with fewer than 500 employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financial services industry faces significant transformative effect of what the convergence of advanced technology and big data can do. As </span><a href="http://irenealdridge.com/ia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irene Aldridge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Visiting Professor of Financial Mathematics at Cornell University and a big data scientist, notes that </span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/big-data-finance-30_us_59dcff8de4b0b8751b878b3d"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Data Finance 3.0 is presently upon us</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Big Data Finance 3.0 is about managing the scale of data and extracting the information within. Today’s big data is about faster, better analytics, an ability to extract that “needle from the haystack” using the latest data science inferences, and storing, managing and integrating ultra-large sets of streaming and historical data of all kinds: market data, social media data, news, regulations, announcements, and so on.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/h2vc/static/reports/innovators/2017/H2-Fintech-Innovators-2017.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data is the lifeblood of any financial institution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and will be a critical foundation for the successful adoption of any advanced analytics and artificial intelligence. The vast majority of the top financial technology companies are using data, analytics and artificial intelligence to fuel their business models.</span></p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The WealthTech industry is one of the most promising areas attracting substantial funding, talent and, probably, the most active on events. </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/build-business-not-channel-launching-robo-advisor-inside-large-bank/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial institutions are aggressively pushing boundaries in response to the rise of tech rivals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And for a good reason – the UK Government estimates that robo-advisory solutions can extend financial opportunities for 16 million people in the country. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pick #1 The Investment Management Strategy II, HM Treasury </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WealthTech enables the provision of advice to mass-market segments, including those that have previously been unreached by financial advice. The FCA estimates that this could be as many as 16 million people in the UK alone. The industry has the opportunity to give millions of people better access to affordable financial advice that meets their needs at every stage of their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech innovations can also help asset managers reduce the number of intermediaries in an investment transaction, and therefore, bring down investment related costs. At present, some parts of the asset management industry rely heavily on companies that provide necessary intermediary services before making an investment transaction on clearing and settlement infrastructure. Disintermediation is the process of streamlining these intermediaries, making the system more efficient and transparent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domestically, FinTech firms have the opportunity to disrupt ways of doing business and bring down costs associated with making an investment to the benefit of the end-investor. One of the most notable emerging sub-sectors of FinTech is WealthTech. Focusing on enhancing wealth management and the retail investment process, WealthTech encompasses technologies derived from wealth management firms, research tools that generate investment solutions and platforms that support financial advisors. The most visible players in this FinTech sub-sector are online wealth managers, commonly known as robo-advisors. </span></p>

                <title>A Lesson on Lending: Alternative Lenders and Community Banks</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/banking/insights/lending/2017/12/08/a-lesson-on-lending-alternative-lenders-and-community-banks/</link>
                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine you are a small-business owner running a profitable family restaurant for several years and looking to expand to another location. To do this, you need a $70,000 loan, but your bank has declined your request. Rather than go to a different bank and complete another three-inch-thick loan application, you may decide to skip this time-consuming, manual application process and instead apply for a loan online through an alternative lender, which only takes a few minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps you are a millennial that wants to start a business. You would like to obtain a small business loan to accomplish this, but obtaining approval for a loan seems like a complex endeavor. Instead, you choose to rely on your personal credit to launch and grow your company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small-business lending is touted as a core component of the community banking business, but community banks often miss opportunities like those above, losing to alternative lenders and larger banks. With interest rates to continue rising in 2018, community banks cannot afford to bypass these revenue-generating opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a survey by the </span><a href="https://www.communitybanking.org/~/media/files/CB21pub_2017_BOOK_web.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Reserve and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, small business lending at community banks fell by 2.2% in 2016, while small business lending at banks with more than $10 billion in assets grew by 5.1%. Additionally, 26% of small businesses that sought funding in 2016 turned to alternative lenders, according to the </span><a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/smallbusiness/2016/SBCS-Report-EmployerFirms-2016.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Reserve’s 2016 Small Business Credit Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In short, today’s community banks are challenged with increased competition, from both banks and their non-bank counterparts, coupled with increasing customer demands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this, community banks are positioned to succeed in the small-business lending space if they can address their areas of weakness and build on their unique strengths. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example, banks have multiple cycles of performance data, which can support more powerful scenario analysis and comprehensive credit models. As economic conditions change, banks can more accurately predict how loan portfolio performance may shift. This is a considerable advantage in the lending space. Conversely, alternative lenders typically use credit models with a 12-month to 24-month loss curve, making it difficult for these lenders to predict how market fluctuations may affect portfolio performance. However, banks do not possess the same portfolio agility that alternative lenders do. Alternative lenders have the ability to make real-time adjustments to their credit model and quickly change their portfolios. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another strength that community banks and other deposit-accepting institutions possess is stable access to liquidity, which serves as a cheap source of funding for small-business loans. Alternative lenders are challenged by limited access to funding, often relying on third-party funding sources. This may prove problematic if and when the economy slows. To combat this and gain access to liquidity, alternative lenders are more frequently seeking bank charters or partnerships with financial institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While collaboration between FinTech companies and banks is largely hailed as a good thing, it recently came to light that </span><a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/large-banks-make-terrible-partners-fintechs-say"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech companies find it incredibly difficult to work with large, tier-one banks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Complaints include claims that banks string these companies along, fail to communicate, and often do not pay in a timely fashion. Some FinTech companies even reported that large banks have stolen intellectual property. Such issues could prove beneficial for community banks as alternative lenders may move downstream and choose to partner with smaller, community financial institutions. Community banks can partner with alternative lenders in a way that complements the bank’s current business model. This could include investing in alternative lenders or buying loans originated on an alternative lender’s platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a starting point, community banks should begin to think about ways to revamp their small business lending processes and make the customer experience a priority. Alternative lending, despite the previously mentioned weaknesses, has grown popular in recent years, largely due to its more convenient customer experience. Rather than taking several hours to complete that three-inch thick loan application, applying for a loan through an alternative lender can take mere minutes and be accomplished online or via mobile. Moreover, the approval time takes hours or days, not months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community banks can mirror alternative lenders’ lending processes by using technology to support online loan applications and power the underwriting and servicing of loans. This enables banks to significantly streamline the small-business loan application process and thus minimize the amount of information that applicants must supply. Banks can modernize the underwriting process by leveraging electronic data sources, including real-time business payment history, along with other technologies such as business intelligence and analytics. These support faster decisioning times and stronger risk mitigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As interest rates rise, community banks should identify ways to automate lending processes and fully leverage digital technologies to meet their customers’ heightened expectations for a better application experience and faster turnaround times. Community banks must also recognize and leverage their strengths, including their strong ties to local communities and access to liquidity and performance data that will help them better capitalize on small-business lending opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative lenders may have an advantage in some areas. Community banks would be wise to learn from these lenders and identify how to close the gaps in their own traditionally cumbersome and rigid lending processes. Doing so will enable community banks to meet market expectations for convenience and speed, positioning themselves for future loan growth and increased profitability.</span></p>

                <title>Daily Review: Defining the Future of Payments, Visa Bets on Biometrics</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/biometrics/insights/payments/2017/12/07/daily-review-future-payments-will-be-defined-by-biometric-technology/</link>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-biometrics-market-is-expected-to-reach-a-value-of-30-bn-by-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">biometrics market is expected to experience a substantial growth over the coming years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some </span><a href="http://www.acuity-mi.com/GBMR_Report.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggest that by 2020, global mobile biometric market revenues will reach $34.6 billion annually. Mobile technology is believed to become a major force in accelerating the adoption of biometrics. More than 800 million biometrically enabled transactions will be completed annually on mobile devices by 2020, generating nearly $7 billion in annual biometric authentication revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To embrace the opportunity and meet ever-increasing consumer expectations from online and offline experiences, Visa makes biometrics the centerpiece of the future of payments. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biometrics centerpiece of Visa's new security roadmap</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa shared its new </span><a href="https://www.visa.com.au/pay-with-visa/security/future-of-security-roadmap.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">security roadmap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, focusing initially on biometrics, with Joe Cunningham, Head of Risk for Asia Pacific at Visa, touting the technology as having an important place in the future of payments.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Cunningham said biometrics are now at a point where Visa and its ecosystem of banks, merchants, FinTech firms, service providers, law enforcement, and cardholders feel comfortable supporting it, as he said certain forms of biometrics have reached a stable and secure level.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">"We always expected biometrics to get to a point where they would play an important role in payments, in fact, we expected biometrics to play an important role in our lives as we go about our day-to-day business whether it's accessing buildings, our car, or an online service," he said. "So there's no surprise that payments have been front and center when it comes to biometric adoption. Everyone thinks of biometrics when they think about payments in the future."</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">In addition to biometrics being the immediate focus of Visa, its 2017 priorities also include educating the ecosystem on 3D Secure version 2.0, and to speed up the use of tokenization.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">"The vision over the long term for security is to completely eliminate all sensitive data from the ecosystem," Cunningham said.</span></li>

                <title>5 Common IT Modernization Use Cases for Financial Services Organizations</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/banking/finance/fintech/insights/it/2017/12/07/5-common-it-modernization-use-cases-for-financial-services-organizations/</link>
                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rise of FinTech has already had huge implications for the financial services industry. From digital currency to digital deposits, financial services organizations are having to divert from their old school ways of closed, monolithic legacy applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Zelle recently launched as a response to the rapid money transfer service from Venmo. Leading banks including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase teamed up to work on a new digital payments solution for rapid money transfer – one that would outperform their existing applications built on legacy technologies. Zelle also recently</span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zelle-expands-partner-ecosystem-300541833.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a number of new technology partners, including IBM, to help accelerate the adoption of Zelle with their financial institution clients, and to help bring them into the modern era of FinTech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the established financial services players that have been dependent on legacy technology and monolithic systems that require significant overhead and lead time to deliver value, many are struggling to satisfy the needs of their customers. In order to remain competitive, this often means a complete transformation toward secure, modern, lightweight applications, which can be a major pain point for financial organizations with these legacy technologies in place. To resolve this, banks and financial institutions are quickly taking advantage of the benefits realized by undergoing a digital transformation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More and more financial services organizations are starting to embrace modern infrastructures with lightweight, mainly open-source technologies, and methodologies like DevOps and microservices, to keep up with competition from the new, agile FinTech companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To bridge the gap between legacy applications and lightweight, modern infrastructure, financial institutions, including some of the top banks in the world, are turning to application modernization toolsets to lead their digital transformations. As digital transformation strategies coalesce into reality, there are five main areas financial IT teams need to focus on:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Application modernization</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern application architectures take advantage of innovative web technologies to speed application development and delivery by giving developers and engineers end‑to‑end control. For financial services organizations, traditional approaches to content delivery can’t keep pace with ever‑increasing demands for application acceleration. To address this, these organizations can use application modernization techniques to ensure a smoother transition to mobile interfaces, faster deployment, more developer agility, and better control over computing resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is also important for organizations looking for a toolset to bridge the gap between several legacy monolithic applications and modern containerized environments. For instance, at NGINX, we’ve recently seen one of the top banks in the US use modern application technologies, including reverse proxy, authentication, requesting routing, and API gateway services to extend a monolithic application with new mobile apps for better cross‐device customer experiences.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud adoption</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critical applications require a platform that meets specific demands. These requirements can be best met cost-effectively through a combination of public cloud for on-demand scalability, private cloud for enhanced data and security protections, and dedicated servers for best-in-class performance and reliability. To meet these requirements, the most innovative enterprises have begun their transition to the hybrid cloud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for financial services organizations looking to move to a hybrid cloud, new challenges arise – from managing disparate infrastructure configurations to keeping data stores synchronized across on-premise and cloud-based servers. Organizations are building hybrid clouds with technology stacks that are not shackled with technology interoperability or vendor lock-in constraints.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving to microservices</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, financial services organizations have relied on homegrown, monolithic applications, which are easier to build in-house. However, this simple approach has huge limitations in that successful applications always grow over time. After a few years, a small, simple application will have grown into a large, complex monolith, leaving development teams in a world of pain. Any attempts at agile development and delivery will flounder as the application is overwhelmingly complex and simply too large for any single developer to fully understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many financial services organizations are solving this problem by adopting a microservices architecture pattern. Instead of building a single monstrous, monolithic application, the idea is to split your application into sets of smaller, interconnected services. Componentizing software functions like this into microservices makes it easier to scale up a project, and easier to maintain. With individual codebases for separate systems, it becomes easier for developers to reason about the effects of changing code. With individual deployments and infrastructure for different services, it becomes easier for DevOps teams to add more computing resources only where they’re needed.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replacing expensive hardware-based solutions</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be prohibitively expensive to scale up proprietary hardware‑based solutions, and dividing application development and deployment between two different teams creates needless delays in the rollout of an improved web app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if enterprises are not moving their infrastructure to the cloud, they’re increasingly adopting more flexible and agile development and deployment methods, and are finding that these provide the features and performance they need for highly available application delivery, while drastically reducing CapEx, OpEx, and even data‑center footprint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software‐based solutions also enable financial services to reduce their dependence on data centers and build out a public/private hybrid cloud with the most effective and scalable infrastructure designed for modern applications.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upgrading from Apache</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Apache HTTP server has been a solid platform for almost any web technology developed over the last 20 years, but time – and the </span><a href="https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2017/11/21/november-2017-web-server-survey.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decline in market share for the top million busiest sites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the last five years – is showing that the architectural decisions made when the code was first laid down are becoming limiting factors in its suitability for modern web demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial services organizations who built their applications on Apache are beginning to see it hit scaling and performance issues. They need a supported web server that is future‐proof for a microservices environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, we’ve recently seen a multi-billion-dollar, multinational financial services corporation migrate a large server farm running Apache and HAProxy. The huge server farm had hit significant performance and scale issues &amp; needed to transition to a more lightweight, high‐performance solution. Using advanced proxy and load‐balancing features enabled the enterprise to create a global infrastructure layer for internal applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re at a crucial point for financial services organizations that need to bring their applications into the 21st century to keep up with new competitors. It’s more important than ever for these organizations to embrace the move to modern, agile technologies like cloud, microservices, and software-based solutions. In doing so, they can take advantage of the massive customer bases they have built, along with their trusted experience, without the worry of losing out to newer, more hotly tipped offerings.</span></p>

                <title>Daily Review: How One Silicon Valley Startup is Reinventing the Home Renting Experience</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/insights/startups/2017/12/06/daily-review-how-one-silicon-valley-startup-reinventing-home-renting-experience/</link>
                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While one of the primary goals of technology is to extend and enhance the quality of services across industries to existing and previously overlooked customers, sometimes, tech innovation can have unintended consequences. One of the interesting stories to read today is about a Silicon Valley startup that attempts to tackle a complex home renting experience. Particularly, the roadblock many face in finding a new home in hot areas, such as San Francisco – the security deposit. The company brings together crowdfunding, cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and payments. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Technology That Aims to Disrupt the Security Deposit</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Rentberry, an online rental marketplace, wants tenants to pay security fees in cryptocurrency and have micro-lenders cover most of the deposit.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“Rentberry turns Craigslist into eBay,” Kriston Capps describes. The service invites potential renters to fill out comprehensive online profiles and participate in an auction-style bidding process for housing—the best offer wins. As a result, in San Francisco and San Jose, Rentberry raised rents by 5%. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Today, Rentberry lists 220,000+ properties in 4,948 cities and is used by 120,000+ people.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Rentberry claims to have found a way to make security deposits cheaper for renters, hassle-free for landlords, and majorly profitable for anonymous third parties—all using cryptocurrency.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Rentberry’s deposit scheme works like this: Landlords will now be able to use the platform’s existing online marketplace to charge a security deposit on a property, using Rentberry’s personal cryptocurrency called BERRYs. Instead of paying the deposit in full, the renters just put down the first 10% as a deductible. Then, a “community” of micro-lenders – a crowd that can range from one to thousands of people—foot the rest of the BERRY bill. Those lenders, in turn, charge renters a yearly interest rate, typically 3-4% of the deposit. As with a normal security deposit, if the landlord doesn’t note any damage at the end of the lease, the initial deductible is returned in full to the renter, and the rest goes back to the lenders.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The benefit for renters is the liberated lost potential of their security deposits. There’s $500 billion in frozen security deposits locked away in banks now.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">However, the “freezer” into which landlords park security deposits isn’t really that cold: In many states, landlords are required or advised to keep security deposits in an escrow account, where they’re also accruing value in interest. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“Security deposits remain the major reason for filings in landlord-tenant court,” said Steve White, CEO of RentPrep, a tenant screening service that has worked closely with landlords since 2007.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Most deposits cost a month or a month-and-a-half’s rent, which means that even for cheaper apartments, tenants must pay more than double their rent upfront to move in. Rentberry’s plan has the potential to offer rental opportunities to those who might otherwise be stopped by that high upfront fee, giving first-time apartment hunters a shot in a competitive market. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">By using blockchain, Rentberry allows landlords to avoid the US banking system and forego escrow accounts, even in states that require them.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rentberry’s scoring system assesses landlords and tenants based on risk level. Renters, too, are subject to reviews and ratings, as well as credit scores, eviction history, and an intensive risk-level assessment based on evaluations from third-party companies.</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payments updates</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s Tez payments app will soon handle your utility bills like a pro</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Tez payments app is set to cross 12 million active users in India soon, and it’s getting some new features to make bill payment a breeze.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">While Tez presently only lets users send and receive money between bank accounts, it’s set to receive an update that will let them connect to service providers – like cooking gas company, electricity board, mobile carrier, and broadband company – to retrieve billing history and pay off pending bills with just a couple of taps. Google has partnered with more than 70 major service providers nationwide in the aforementioned categories.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Once users add a service and enter the details with which they signed it up, Tez will automatically pull in previous bills, help complete your payments, and even notify of future bills when they come in. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Tez has processed 140 million transactions since its launch in September and accounted for 73% of UPI-based transactions in the country last month. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Next year, Google plans to add more functionality to make the app useful for independent merchants and small businesses (it already has 525,000 entrepreneurs using Tez for various kinds of transactions already).</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unicorn Rising: How This South Korean PayPal-Backed Startup Churns $1B A Month</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Viva Republica is the most disruptive FinTech startup in South Korea. After a $48 million PayPal-backed investment in March, its flagship app Toss has grown from a simple money transfer app to a platform of diverse consumer finance services generating $20 million in expected revenue in 2017.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Toss, now the fastest-growing mobile P2P payment service globally, has reached $12 billion transaction volume this year – an average $1 billion a month.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Putting that into context, Venmo, another PayPal-backed startup, took four years to reach the same rate and is currently processing $2.5 billion in monthly transactions. But Toss, with 12 million users, was able to reach that benchmark in about half the time and has sights on breaking even in the near future – a global first in the P2P payments space.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">With the customer loyalty it earned through its P2P payments, users would expect the same robust user experience across all services on Toss. That allowed them to keep its customers on the app and adopt the new services. Its core revenue stream has shifted from its original product to the creation of new savings accounts.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Within 30 days of launching a mutual fund investment feature through a partnership with Shinhan Securities, Toss contributed 30% of the company’s mutual fund sales. Toss also began showing users their own credit scores to coach them on how to manage and improve their credit scores.</span></li>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LTP Team had the pleasure of interviewing </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradweisberg1/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brad Weisberg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CEO &amp; Founder of </span><a href="http://www.snapsheetapp.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapsheet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a provider of virtual claims technology used by auto insurance carriers to optimize workflows, speed up claims processes, and provide superior service to their customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope you enjoy our interview with Brad as much as we did!</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28595" src="/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-1.12.11-PM.png" alt="Helping Insurers Adjust to the New Reality of the Sharing Economy – Interview With Brad Weisberg, CEO &amp; Founder of Snapsheet" width="1480" height="1326" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Brad Weisberg, CEO &amp; Founder of Snapsheet</strong></span></p>
<p><b>LTP: Brad, a pleasure to speak with you. Please tell us a little bit about yourself. </b></p>
<p><b>Brad Weisberg: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am the CEO and Co-founder of Snapsheet, a leading provider of virtual claims technology. Before founding Snapsheet, I was drawn to the innovation and nimbleness of the startup world and served as the VP of Global Sales at Where I’ve Been, which was acquired by TripAdvisor in 2011. I continue to champion the startup community and am passionate about bringing creative people together to solve today’s complex problems. </span></p>
<p><b>LTP: Give us a paragraph pitch of your company.</b></p>
<p><b>BW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapsheet is the pioneering provider of virtual claims technology used by auto insurance carriers to optimize workflows, speed up claims processes, and provide superior service to their customers. Our cloud-based software enables carriers to virtually process a claim with photos taken by the user via their smartphone. Through a multitude of technologies housed on our platform, we’re able to help insurance providers process claims quicker, allowing customers to be paid faster and back in safe, repaired vehicles sooner. </span></p>
<p><b>LTP: What problem are you solving today? </b></p>
<p><b>BW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re solving a variety of problems, as Snapsheet’s workflow improvements encompass all stages of the claims process. We help carriers and their claimants step-by-step through the entire claims journey – from first notice of loss and estimation, all the way to repair and payment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even now, the insurance industry relies heavily on legacy technology and manual processes. Nearly all claims payments are still paid by check, which can be a costly and burdensome experience. To solve this problem, Snapsheet came together with KeyBank to create </span><a href="https://www.snapsheettransactions.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapsheet Transactions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a solution that enables carriers to pay claimants virtually. </span></p>
<p><b>LTP: Who are you selling to?</b></p>
<p><b>BW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our customers are insurance carriers. Our role is to work closely with carriers, not disrupt the industry. Thanks to partnerships with carriers, we’re on track to process about 450,000 claims this year. With the launch of Snapsheet Transactions, we are able to expand our customer base beyond auto insurance.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP: Why did you start the company? </b></p>
<p><b>BW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating from Indiana University, I moved to L.A. to work as a production assistant for HBO. On my way to work one day, I got into a fender bender. I took my car to three different body shops and received three completely different estimates. Throughout this painful and long experience, I thought to myself, “There’s got to be an easier way.” I pooled all of my savings together and founded BodyShopBids, which later evolved into Snapsheet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move from BodyShopBids to Snapsheet happened in 2013. We determined that targeting consumers directly was not a sustainable business model. At the recommendation of a customer, we pivoted to working with insurance carriers. He introduced us to carriers who were very interested in the product, and we rebranded to Snapsheet. Although changing the direction of the company was challenging, there is no doubt that this was the right move for us.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP: What's the most important change coming to your segment in the next 3-5 years?</b></p>
<p><b>BW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a straight line between the expansion of the sharing economy and the rise of InsurTech. As the sharing economy is embraced by late adopters, there will be a massive shift in consumer expectations, and InsurTechs such as ours will be there to help insurance carriers adjust to these shifts.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP: What’s your next milestone?</b></p>
<p><b>BW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, we came together with KeyBank, one of the largest bank-based financial services companies in the United States, for the launch of Snapsheet Transactions. Together with KeyBank’s treasury knowledge and our insurance workflows expertise, we provide the technology needed to simplify claims and offer the optimal customer experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a significant need for digital payments. Looking at natural disasters like Hurricane Harvey, the importance of digital payments is more apparent than ever. After a hurricane, or any disaster for that matter, people can’t wait to receive a check in the mail. Snapsheet Transactions solves that problem for carriers and claimants.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP: What's one thing you wish customers knew before a sales meeting? </b></p>
<p><b>BW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wish customers knew how essential a good understanding of insurance workflows is, which other InsurTech companies don’t always have. Because we have a strong foundation with carriers, implementing Snapsheet is easy and the onboarding process for new clients is seamless.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP: What keeps you awake at night?</b></p>
<p><b>BW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that there is a better way and many people are going through countless hoops and not getting the answers they need. There’s no reason for that with the technology Snapsheet has made available to carriers. We have helped solve a big problem and it is important that more people have access to our solution.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP: Anything else you want to say to our audience?</b></p>
<p><b>BW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our aim is to make the entire claims process simple for everyone, so we’re constantly looking for ways to meet customer expectations that are actionable for carriers. Creating Snapsheet Transactions is just one step towards creating a seamless process from start to finish.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP Team: Thank you, Brad!</b></p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The brave new world of global finance is getting braver. Real-time and near-real-time payments systems have changed the fabric of online commerce." - Patricia Pozuelo, Enterprise Technology Specialist, Intel</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Global Race for Real-Time Payments</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">30+ countries have real-time payment processes of some kind (for example, Faster Payments in the UK, Singapore’s FAST); several have been in use for decades. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The reasons the US lags in development of its own RTP system: 1. The sheer number of financial institutions in the country compared to the rest of the world – the US has roughly 5,300 commercial banks and more than 6,000 credit unions; 2. Complicated regulations process; 3. The US’ complex regulatory process – 50 regulators + more than 20 federal agencies that all need to provide approval in order to implement RTP restructuring. The UK has one single agency.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The majority of Europe is already onboard with these streamlining banking upgrades as well, with countries like Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, and the Netherlands putting RTP services into practice nationally.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The Swiss National Bank has been ahead of the curve since 1987 when it introduced its 24-hour payment-processing SIC system and revolutionized the world of pre-internet banking.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">China’s mobile and digital payment market was the largest in the world at $1.83 trillion in 2016. Most of that activity comes from two companies: Alipay and Tenpay.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Japan has had their Zengin System running near-RTP for years, which is about to get an upgrade. SBI Ripple Asia recently announced the creation of a consortium of 42 member banks that will use Ripple’s new round-the-clock blockchain technology for payments and settlement.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The rest of the industrialized world has already implemented or started implementing fast-payment systems, including Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, India, and Australia.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">US P2P payments users are expected to grow to 126 million by 2020, with non-banks leading much of the charge. WEF estimates that 80% of banks are currently developing blockchain projects. About 19 of the biggest financial firms in the US all signed on for a new P2P payments network Zelle. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">FIS and The Clearing House also launched a nationwide RTP system during the first quarter of 2017, which could garner up to $1.1 billion in revenues. Both banks are also members of the Federal Reserve’s Faster Payments Task Force Steering Committee, which will soon start evaluating new approaches for implementing RTP across the country.</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley Undercuts Rivals With Robo</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has launched its online platform, Access Investing, with an annual fee below those of its wirehouse rivals. The program fee: 0.35% of assets under management per year. The robo portfolios include mutual funds and ETFs with both active and passive strategies. They also feature automated rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting at no additional charge.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Merrill Edge Guided Investing robo-service charges 0.45%, and Wells Fargo’s Intuitive Investor offering has a 0.50% fee. Discount brokerages Schwab, Fidelity and Vanguard all charge less than Morgan Stanley for advisor-focused robo services: 0.28% for Schwab Intelligent Advisor, 0.30% for Vanguard Personal Advisor Services, and 0.15% for Fidelity AMP. These fees don't include expenses on the underlying funds. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">While Morgan Stanley’s has a $5,000 account minimum, the competing Wells Fargo service can be accessed with $10,000 or more of client assets.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Morgan Stanley Access Investing is an opportunity for financial advisors to grow their book of business by making connections with prospects earlier and eventually establishing full-service relationships when clients are ready.” - Naureen Hassan, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley's Chief Digital Officer.</span></span></li>

                <title>Why Mobile Credit Can Be the Entry Ticket to Financial Inclusion</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/credit/finance/financial%20inclusion/fintech/insights/mobile/2017/12/05/why-mobile-credit-can-be-entry-ticket-to-financial-inclusion/</link>
                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term ‘credit’ means different things to different people. In a developed economy, it’s about measuring the value of one’s availability to receive goods and services based on the expectation that they will be paid back. A credit score is as important as a social security number, driver’s license or passport in establishing identity and offering opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet for the majority of people around the world, the idea of credit is just that – an idea. The lack of access to formal financial services – or any kind of financial identity – makes building a credit profile impossible. People in these cash-based societies are limited not just in acquiring financing to provide opportunity and relief, but they are often hampered in accessing their own cash during off-hours when stores or banks are closed, in remote locations, or during times of crises such as natural disasters.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Financial Identity Matters</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The modern lifestyle demands accessibility to funding that is often beyond our current means. Think for a moment of what your life would be like with no access to credit. Chances are you wouldn’t own a home or a car. Most of us could not have afforded our college education. The entrepreneurs among us would be hard-pressed to build successful businesses. And what about the ways we take advantage of credit cards – basically small-time loans that exist to allow us to pay for emergencies and unexpected expenses? Our financial identity is tied up in our access to these credit opportunities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The developing world has little to no access to these resources, largely because they have no financial identity. This is an environment where less than </span><a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialinclusion/overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">half of adults and small businesses own a bank account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and only one in ten people have access to credit. Yet it could be argued that a financial identity in these societies is even more vital, as the average person is informally employed and income can vary from day to day, week to week, or month to month. As is so often the case, those who need it most have the least amount of opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news, however, is that mobile devices – along with the existence of the cloud – are providing an entirely new landscape for the developing world. This landscape involves assigning a financial identity to those who have largely remained anonymous, reaching these populations through their smartphones. There are scores of creditworthy people on the planet, and </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/data-driven-mobile-financial-services-hold-key-to-unlocking-70-bn-dollars-telcos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we’ve proven before through data science</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that worthiness has little to do with income or wealth, but instead with the opportunity to demonstrate responsibility.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication as a Commodity: A Microcosm of How Credit Provides Value</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take for example a recent discovery by our data scientists at Juvo. These scientists have access to the communication habits of millions of people scattered all around the world, and as they analyzed the ways individuals reach out to one another, an interesting pattern emerged. People, regardless of location, culture, background – and yes, even wealth – value communication equally. In a comparison of countries with GDPs that range as much as 1000%, individuals spent roughly the same percentage of their income on communication and data.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Analysis of communication patterns around the world</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28584" src="/uploads/2017/12/ju1.png" alt="Why Mobile Credit Can Be the Entry Ticket to Financial Inclusion" width="1024" height="630" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So knowing communication and access to the outside world is a high priority regardless of income, we were curious how this commodity would be treated when resources are scarce, such as during a natural disaster. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When natural disasters strike in cash-based societies, one of the first things to happen is a run on cash. Stores, ATMs, and banks run out of money, and individuals are left without access to vital resources. Communication has proven to be as necessary a commodity as food or water in times of crises, and populations with access to some form of credit are able to take advantage of opportunities even when cash is scarce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this understanding in mind, we reviewed activity in the wake of recent hurricanes that rocked the Caribbean and observed a spike in prepaid mobile users topping up their phone allowances via on-demand credit extensions prior to hurricanes making landfall.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Credit-to-Cash Ratio just prior to Hurricanes Irma and Maria </b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28585" src="/uploads/2017/12/ju2.png" alt="Why Mobile Credit Can Be the Entry Ticket to Financial Inclusion" width="720" height="404" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What's even more striking is what takes place when the eye of the storm actually reach landfall. The following image shows the ratio of airtime credit extensions to cash top-ups as the eye of Hurricane Irma hit the Leeward Islands as well as Turks &amp; Caicos.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Credit-to-Cash Ratio during Hurricane Irma Landfall</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28586" src="/uploads/2017/12/ju3.png" alt="Why Mobile Credit Can Be the Entry Ticket to Financial Inclusion" width="1072" height="633" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As Irma made landfall, purchasing airtime from shops become extremely difficult, if not impossible. The graph above shows what happens when cash based-top ups are not possible. When traditional outlets were no longer available, users in these markets turned to their smartphones and their mobile financial identity to top-up and remain connected through and after the disaster. Many of these users had established a financial identity which enabled them to progress to borrowing a month of airtime credit during the hurricane for both voice and data use. Without this access, these users would have had to go without communication during the most intense moments of the storm – and after. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability of previously anonymous, prepaid users to take advantage of financial services and resources via their smartphone is particularly compelling when resources are otherwise unavailable. In many developing parts of the world, it isn’t just a natural disaster that limits access. Geographic and time constraints contribute, as does the availability of work, family issues, one’s health or any myriad of reasons that prevent the instant availability of necessary cash and accompanying resources.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Relationship Between Identity, Credit and Financial Inclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For these reasons, creating a mobile financial identity in order to provide mobile credit remains the best place to start to address financial exclusion in many parts of the world and smartphones are the most logical vehicle for providing it. Nearly 80% of people all across the globe have prepaid phones, and there are nearly $1 trillion in transactions taking place every day. This equates to a huge opportunity to meet people where they are, at the moment they need it, with real opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ways in which smartphones are reaching into every corner of the globe is truly transformative. It is incredibly exciting to be involved in the convergence of FinTech and mobile, and watch how these two industries will provide substantial opportunities to people around the world. Identity opens doors. It helps people access financial opportunities they wouldn’t otherwise have. It provides a means to necessary resources across disparate location, time and circumstance and provides a clear pathway toward greater financial access and inclusion. Building a financial identity is as vital to the emerging economy as it is to well-established ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a unique moment in time – something that could not have happened even five years ago. New populations of people are providing real benefit to mobile operators and financial services alike. The ubiquity of the cloud, along with smartphones, is driving emerging credit opportunities across the globe. In turn, those opportunities are driving financial inclusion.</span></p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robots are coming. But don’t worry – they’re here to help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next few years, chatbots will take on a bigger role within the remittance industry. Reports on the overall chatbot market show an expected compound annual growth rate of</span><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170728005739/en/Chatbots-Market-Reach-3.1-Billion-2021-Analysis"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">35.2%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 2016 to 2021 – eventually topping $3 billion. However, if done right, the opportunity within remittances could be much more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wondering what all the fuss is about? From </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/chatbots-will-enable-deeper-engagement-and-build-stronger-customer-loyalty/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transforming the user experience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to improving fraud detection, to delivering new levels of customer service, chatbots are primed to bring significant improvements to the world of money transfer.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ditching the form – a new user experience</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no doubt that </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/future-of-financial-services-mobile-and-instant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mobile devices are revolutionizing the way we make payments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Instead of relying on in-person interactions, customers are more likely to opt for the convenience of mobile. In the US alone, mobile payments volume will</span><a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/US+Mobile+Payments+Will+More+Than+Triple+By+2021/-/E-RES132017"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">more than triple by 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For remittances, chatbots can similarly transform the tedious data collection process. Mobile devices enable consumers to make payments anytime, anywhere </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but the experience can still leave much to be desired. Never-ending forms and interfaces that aren’t optimized for mobile have the potential to alienate consumers who want a faster way to submit payment information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With chatbots, that issue may become a thing of the past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through a series of questions to collect and confirm important details, chatbots can create a money transfer experience that is both simple and convenient. This should speed up the process, improve the quality of information provided, and tailor the set of questions to the minimum information needed from that customer for that transfer. Moreover, a chatbot experience has the potential to capture customer attention and increase referrals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using a chatbot that efficiently collects payment information, the stage is set for a more enjoyable experience that will keep customers coming back more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud mitigation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud is one of the top concerns for any mobile payments company. Efforts by remittance companies to stop fraudsters often clutter the customer’s experience and slow the settlement process. </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/how-banks-regulators-are-applying-machine-learning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning is the wave of the present for fighting fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both because of its effectiveness and the user experience it enables. However, this behind-the-scenes magic is dependent on a key factor - data inputs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a chatbot, remittance companies will have access to data rarely present in the payment industry, including language, spelling, punctuation, and response time. Each of these data points can be used as data inputs for a remittance company’s machine learning fraud prevention engine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased engagement through chatbots will create a stronger digital fingerprint for new customers and help remittance companies streamline the experience for loyal customers. Better yet, remittance companies will lower costs by making it harder for bad guys to game the system - creating a competitive advantage and savings that can be passed along to the customer.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real-time customer service</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most consumers, one element of the payment experience rises above the rest – speed. Nearly</span><a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/16-03-03-your_customers_dont_want_to_call_you_for_support/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">three out of four consumers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> say that valuing their time is the most important thing a company can do to provide them with good customer service. Chatbots make it even easier to be available to customers when they need help without sacrificing their overall experience.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps most importantly, chatbots help transfer control back to the consumer. It is not uncommon for questions to pop up during the remittance process. Chatbots can ensure real-time answers. Rather than picking up the phone or meeting with a customer service representative in person, consumers can immediately get the help they need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though chatbots may not yet offer the same personal touch as an in-person interaction, the speed, and convenience of the experience isn’t too far off. In each case, the results remain the same – real-time answers at a moment’s notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shift from an in-person to chatbot-enabled remittance experience isn’t too concerning for most people. In fact,</span><a href="https://research.hubspot.com/reports/artificial-intelligence-is-here"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">40 percent of consumers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> don’t care whether a chatbot or a person answers their customer service questions. Rather than focusing on the way in which answers are delivered, consumers are much more enamored with getting in, getting out and getting on their way.</span></p>
<h2><b>A chatbot-enabled future</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past few decades, technology has propelled the payments industry forward. With the rise of the internet and mobile devices, global remittances are taking place more than ever before. And with that, chatbots are reintroducing the ability to ask questions – and get answers – at a moment’s notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to remittances, the benefits of chatbots are twofold. Not only can consumers continue to enjoy the convenience of digitally fueled money transfers, but they also have the opportunity to calm any fraud- or service-related concerns before going ahead with a transaction. Taking a chance on chatbot technology opens the door to delivering a payment experience marked by increased control, security, and convenience. </span></p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual real estate is the perfect storm in the making, and blockchain technology may become its driving force in the 2018 and beyond. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Blockchain Is Breathing New Life Into Virtual Real Estate</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">VR is projected to become a $40 billion industry by 2020.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s modern VR platforms leverage emerging technologies such as blockchain to make virtual property ownership and trade more secure. Virtual reality platform </span><a href="https://decentraland.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentraland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, uses blockchain to identify and designate ownership of land in its virtual world.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Because of the various possible applications of VR, virtual real estate can function similarly to real-world properties that they can be sold, leased, and used for virtual activities. Blockchain could help formalize the market for these virtual properties.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">New VR technologies are bringing a resurgence of interest in virtual worlds. Improved headsets now showcase high-resolution display panels that allow for better visuals. Hardware such as tactile gloves can now also offer finer controls and haptic feedback creating more immersive experiences for users.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">As an investment opportunity, virtual real estate offers rewards comparable to real-world properties. High traffic areas in virtual worlds are prime locations for commercial use and brand visibility. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Modern VR platforms can even allow for a variety of campaigns that maximize the sensory capabilities of the new hardware. Businesses could create showrooms where customers can see products in 3D and even “feel” them. The perfect storm is brewing for VR. The improvements in the VR hardware are allowing for richer experiences. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Beyond gaming and virtual exploration, developers on decentralized platforms could even look into creating virtual venues for events such as concerts, shows, and sports. Similar to real-world events, marketers can use these to push brands and even virtual merchandise.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/omribarzilay/2017/11/30/how-blockchain-is-breathing-new-life-into-virtual-real-estate/#70285399511e"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto-updates </span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coinbase must share users' cryptocurrency data with the IRS</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Coinbase will be forced to share the financial information of 14,355 users with the IRS, following a California federal court ruling. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The data sharing affects every user who has bought, sold, sent or received more than $20,000 through their accounts in a single year between 2013 and 2015. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The company will have to turn over the user's name, date of birth, address, and taxpayer ID, plus records of all account activity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Coinbase has some six million users, but fewer than 1,000 have officially declared cryptocurrency activity.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next stop in the cryptocurrency craze: A government-backed coin</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Central banks around the world are busy experimenting with their own versions of cryptocurrency. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">China's central bank announced in January that it has completed a successful trial run of transacting digital currencies among banks. In September, Japan, Sweden, and Estonia all announced similar digital currency projects: J-coin for Japan, E-krona for Sweden and Estcoin for Estonia. The UK, Uruguay, and Kazakhstan have all expressed similar ambitions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">"The [Chinese government thinks] that [cryptocurrencies] could potentially threaten the central government control over the financial system." – Paul Triolo, Practice Head of Geotechnology at Eurasia Group. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">William Dudley, President &amp; CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said the Fed is exploring the idea of offering its own digital currency. "To me, the idea of cryptocurrency is free of control from any person and institution. There's nothing cryptocurrency about these [government-backed projects]," said Jacob Eliosoff, investment manager of Trevi Digital Assets Fund.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The market of cryptocurrencies is expected to reach $2 trillion in 2018.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Rod Garratt, an economics professor at UCSB (University of California, Santa Barbara), thinks "if there was a central bank cryptocurrency that provides some anonymity, then it would be a very close substitute for Bitcoin, except it would not provide autonomy. So it really comes down to what feature people desire."</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">"Central banks don't get to decide whether or not Bitcoin is there or not; Bitcoin is there," said Garratt.</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech updates</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why PayPal Is Teaming Up with Acorns</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">PayPal recently announced the integration of its platform with Acorns Grow, a mobile app that provides automated savings and investment services that mainly target millennials. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The integration will allow PayPal users to link their accounts with the Acorns app to be able to automatically save and invest through the Acorns app whenever they make a purchase using PayPal. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Acorns provides robo-advisor services. Subscribers link their debit/credit cards or digital wallets to the Acorns app and whenever they make a purchase, the app rounds up their spending to the nearest dollar and then invests the change. Acorns charges $1.00 a month to manage the investment portfolios of its subscribers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Robo-advisors such as Acorns and Betterment are expected to have $385 billion worth of assets under investment by 2021. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">PayPal closed 3Q17 with 218 million active customer accounts with the vast majority of the accounts belonging to consumers. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">For PayPal, the tie-up with Acorns fits the ambition to offer a broader range of financial services as it seeks to diversify its revenue streams. Additionally, the integration with Acorns could help PayPal attract more users, especially those left out of the mainstream investment services because of high fees or other barriers.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want a loan? Make sure you’re tweeting the right things</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The article that someone tweeted about, posts that they liked on Facebook, and a new phone just bought on an e-commerce site – all these events now play a crucial role in determining if an individual is eligible for a loan or not.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">In India's online lending ecosystem, firms are heavily relying on unconventional data to assess a consumer’s loan eligibility. New-age firms are moving away from traditional methods to judge repayment capacities and, based on their own algorithms, are coming up with dynamic credit scores to effectively assess a customer’s creditworthiness.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The 166 million households that make up middle-income India – with annual earnings of between $3,414 to $5,572 – typically apply for personal loans to buy consumer durables, for weddings, to meet medical expenses, set up a new business, and the likes. These consumers are a potential goldmine for online lending firms because they include many first-time borrowers who may struggle to understand the exhaustive paperwork and procedures to secure a loan from traditional banks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“As a consumer, our needs are evolving and we need scenarios where there is a faster turnaround time. By using AI and algorithms, we can drastically reduce the time taken to approve a loan request, compared to the traditional lenders.” – Manav Jeet, CEO of Rubique. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">FinTech players can decide to lend within a few minutes by using algorithms that can collect supporting personal, professional, and financial details of potential borrowers. The list of items assessed can include social media profiles, friends on social media, payment history for telecom bills (for postpaid customers), geographical locations, online shopping history, devices used for surfing, lifestyle details, the internet usage timings, consumption patterns, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“We have about 80-90 parameters that are used to check a consumer’s creditworthiness. And that’s where technology comes into play to ensure that it can be done swiftly and efficiently." – Satyam Kumar, Co-founder, LoanTap. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">In certain cases, relying on alternate data to determine creditworthiness may be a better way than how banks go about it.</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IoT world</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hottest IoT applications for 2018</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">IoT is going to expand on its current strengths in the coming year, broadening its presence in the industrial, energy and transportation sectors and continuing to see growing usage in fields like healthcare and retail.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“Newer use cases and deployment across the distributed enterprise, retail and logistics, healthcare and smart cities will provide increased momentum across these verticals.” – Rohit Mehra, IDC Vice President for network infrastructure research. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">One common theme for new IoT deployments in 2018 involves the coordination of high-value infrastructure that occupies relatively large geographical areas. – Northeastern University Silicon Valley campus IoT program director Kilton Hopkins</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“Many verticals still have business operations that involve manual observation of equipment status, inventory levels, and other key metrics,” he said. “Where there is currently manual observation, there may be a great opportunity for a high-ROI project involving IoT. Some verticals that have a lot of manual observations are oil and gas, energy distribution, supply chain, and telecommunications.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Large-scale management application is becoming more attractive in part because the technology around IoT is advancing quickly. – Northeastern University Silicon Valley dean P.K. Agarwal. “Device management and connectivity management has been around for several years already, but now that the pieces of IoT systems are coming together to form whole enterprise-scale solutions, management of these solutions has become higher up on the ‘tech wish list’ for organizations.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“The hype around and growing adoption of intelligent agents like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant in more and more devices will open marketers’ eyes to new ways of interacting with customers more than any other recent technology has — including wearables.” </span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interesting reads on Amazon</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Consumer Brands Can Succeed In An Amazon World</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon was quick to prioritize serving its most loyal customer base with a fast mobile app that makes for an enjoyable shopping experience, catering to the modern-day, ‘on-the-go’ consumer. The app receives over 75,000 downloads a day in the United States alone. With mobile-optimized features such as predictive and voice search, a customer can quickly narrow their search for a product and filter through Amazon’s extensive catalog. Users can also specify faster delivery preferences by activating the “Prime” feature, and then within a couple of clicks, seamlessly checkout. Amazon has also created success with its “Prime Day” shopping holiday. Similar to Black Friday, Prime Day encourages more spending on Amazon with exclusive discounts and offers and fast shipping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By prioritizing the user experience, including, fast search, simple and often free returns, frictionless payments, and creating events that drive a sense of urgency from an already loyal customer base, the e-commerce giant has created an exemplary business model to envy and one that brands should borrow from and emulate as they prepare for 2018.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competition in the AI Cloud Is Heating Up, and Amazon Just Made a Big Move</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The cloud is no longer just a data dump—it’s an AI battleground, and Amazon wants to beat all comers into submission.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">At an event in Las Vegas, Amazon announced a raft of new AI services that it hopes will allow it to stave off competition and maintain its cloud lead.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Chief among the new offerings is a series of off-the-shelf AI software packages that users can run on Amazon’s servers: 1) Transcribe, which converts speech in audio files into clean, time-stamped, punctuated text; 2) Translate uses deep learning to shift texts between seven languages. Comprehend can detect sentiment in text; 3) Rekognition can detect and track people, activities, and objects in video; 4) The firm has also launched an AI development platform called SageMaker, which is designed to make it easier for developers to build and train their own neural networks and run them on petabyte-scale data sets. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The idea is to make it easy for newbie developers to embrace AI on Amazon’s cloud.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">There’s also a new deep-learning-enabled programmable video camera, called DeepLens, that is powerful enough to run its own AI algorithms and seems to be intended as a gateway for developers keen to understand what AI can do when combined with hardware.</span></li>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <ul>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em><b>The mobile payment service is now part of the Italian Public Administration’s electronic payment system</b></em></span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em><b>Paying taxes, fines and service fees by smartphone has never been so easy, fast and convenient</b></em></span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>#doitsmart</b></p>
<p><b>Milan, 27 November 2017 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span><b>Satispay</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the mobile payment app that is revolutionizing the electronic payments sector, has joined </span><b>PagoPA</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Italian Public Administration’s single payment system that enables citizens to pay for public services (taxes, fines, car taxes, health co-pays, etc.) quickly and easily, online, without having to queue at a branch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new agreement between PagoPA and Satispay is part of the broader </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three-Year Plan for ICT in Public Administration</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a document providing strategic and economic guidance on the digital transformation of the country’s PA. The plan’s main objectives include encouraging the adoption of enabling platforms such as SPID (digital identity), ANPR (national registry), and PagoPA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PagoPA, which has already been adopted by thousands of government offices, banks, post offices, credit institutions and businesses, allows citizens to pay for public services conveniently from home and provides various advantages, such as advance information about the cost of a transaction and receipts to document payments, which are booked in real time, making them immediately visible to payees. This flexible, modern system is intended to bridge Italy’s digital gap and make its public administration system more responsive to citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Satispay’s role in this process is to serve as an extremely simple, fast and convenient alternative method of payment: in 2017, the taxpayer’s charges for each transaction will be borne by Satispay, whereas from 2018, the fees will be just €0.20 for payments over €10 with no charge for smaller amounts. Yet, using Satispay to make payments provides much greater value, represented above all by the extreme speed and simplicity with which citizens can fulfill their obligations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To use Satispay to pay for public services, users simply select Satispay as their method of payment on the page where the total amount is calculated, confirm that they wish to pay with Satispay, and enter their mobile telephone number into the window that is displayed. Through the Satispay app installed on their smartphones (all brands and operating systems are supported), they will then immediately receive a notification, which they can accept in order to complete the payment in few seconds and receive an immediate receipt by email.</span></p>
<p><b>Alberto Dalmasso</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>CEO of Satispay</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, commented, “Satispay was founded with the precise goal of changing people’s daily payment habits, making their lives easier and generating savings, above all in terms of time. We have been working towards this goal with dedication and we have reached important agreements and milestones in the course of this year. Early on — when we were not yet in supermarkets or the stores of famous brands — the Italian government’s Digital Transformation Team recognized Satispay as one of the tools capable of contributing to the strategic project of digitalizing Italy. Over the past year, the opportunity to join PagoPA — a project central to the digital transformation of Italy — constantly stimulated us to do better and provide citizens with an efficient service that would profoundly simplify the way they manage their lives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Satispay app has been downloaded 380,000 times and the service has 220,000 active users to date. There are 21,000 businesses participating in the system, increasing by 80 each day. In Italy, more than 26,000 stores accept payments by Satispay.</span></p>
<p><b>Satispay </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Satispay is a mobile payment system that allows users to transfer money using an alternative network that does not rely on credit and debit cards. The service is efficient, free and secure. Available for download for iPhone, Android, and Windows Phone, Satispay can be used by anyone with a bank account. Sending money to phone contacts and paying in stores (online and physical) is as easy as sending a message or checking-in on social media. The service is entirely free of charge for users: there are no signup costs or charges for sending or receiving payments. There are no activation fees or monthly fees for physical and online businesses participating in the service, just a fixed fee of €0.20 for payments of more than €10: there are no fees at all for payments below this amount. Satispay S.p.A. is an innovative startup and a result of the hard work of a young Italian team. Following its previous financing rounds, the company recently completed a significant capital increase, bringing its total funding to €26.8 million. In addition to its clear economic advantages, Satispay also enables an improved customer experience by making payments faster and more efficient and reducing waiting times at the register. These are the reasons that are convincing small stores and large brands such as the following to add Satispay to their payment options: Esselunga, Coop, Trenord, Benetton, Caffè Vergnano, Venchi, Domino’s Pizza, Grom, MyChef, Gruppo Cigierre, Total Erg, Kasanova, Repsol, Freddy, Moleskine, Arcaplanet, MC2 St. Barth, Sorelle Ramonda, and Vivigas.</span></p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-October, FinTech firm </span><a href="https://conta.mobi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conta.MOBI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides payment account (including a free version), announced a collaboration with </span><a href="http://www2.correios.com.br/sistemas/rastreamento/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Correios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the state-owned company that operates the national postal service of Brazil. With this partnership, conta.MOBI enables its users to make deposits and withdrawals through the network of Correios, using the CPF as identification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The partnership provides conta.MOBI with a capability that no financial institution has, since Correios is an institution present in all cities of the country, with its own service and outsourced resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, the partnership includes only Correios' own agencies, but the intention of the companies is that the partnership extends to the whole network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Correios, conta.MOBI clients could already make withdrawals through the network of </span><a href="https://www.banco24horas.com.br/index/evento-banco24horas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banco24horas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ATMs, as well as perform transactions through a Visa prepaid card. Whoever opens a conta.MOBI account automatically receives the Visa virtual card and can apply for a physical one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a basic plan account and no monthly fee, the conta.MOBI's target audience are individual micro-entrepreneurs (known as MEI). The most expensive plan is BR$ 9.90 (~3 USD) monthly. Approximately 55% of the startup’s customer base today is MEI.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrepreneurs may have a POS system and charge through WhatsApp</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conta.MOBI was created in 2013 at Stanford University and started operating in 2014. Currently the company has a team of more than 50 employees. </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardocapucio-empreendedor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ricardo Capucio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CEO, explains that the account is called "payment account" and has many functions similar to the traditional bank account. It differs from checking account basically by not providing credit and for not receiving interbank credit transfers such as TED (Express Wire Transfer) or DOC (Credit Transfer Document), but only to transfer to other accounts. "The payment account is a more modern account, which allows you to receive without being tied to a bank," Capucio notes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefit for entrepreneurs is to have more possibilities of receiving payments: credit and debit through a payment link – which can be sent by social networks and WhatsApp, the most popular messaging app in the country; by ticket; by deposit made at the post office and also through the POS terminal that can also be integrated into the account. Each way of receiving has a specific fee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The partnership "is part of the strategy of replacing postal activity, which is declining worldwide. This possibility of adding products takes advantage of the reach of Correios, one of the oldest and dearest companies in the country," said Guilherme Campos, president of Correios. Campos said that the plan was presented by Ricardo, president of the account.MOBI last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the partnership of the conta.MOBI and Correios is available for the states of Minas Gerais and São Paulo, and according to Capucio, it must be available nationwide in January 2018.</span></p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Amazon knows something about me that a bank never will. It knows everything about my revenue, and they know my audience – that's something that I might not even know. It lets Amazon take this risk that a bank cannot," </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/silicon-valley-wants-to-become-the-next-wall-street-2513498729.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lex Sokolin, Global Director of FinTech Strategy at Autonomous Next. "Information makes risk-taking cheaper because you know who's going to default and who's not. It shows you how much more insidious it is to compete with a platform that truly knows you and your data."</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Tech's Next Prey: Big Finance</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Look for Big Tech – with caches of data about billions of people around the globe – to power the next jumps in financial technology, keeping users reined within their own, ever-expanding platforms and absorbing billions in profit that otherwise would have gone to traditional financiers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Amazon Lending has lent $3 billion to merchants since 2011. Google's venture arm is ramping up investments in cross-border currency transfers and Blockchain. China's tech giants have crashed onto American shores: cabs in New York and Las Vegas began accepting Alipay, Alibaba's mobile payment juggernaut.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Groundbreaking Blockchain service that runs on Azure could transform how companies raise money</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UK-based firm </span><a href="https://www.nivaura.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nivaura</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helped launch the world’s first automated bond issue in a cryptocurrency on a public Blockchain platform.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Nivaura has developed an Ethereum Blockchain-based service, which runs on the secure Microsoft cloud platform Azure, that reduces the need for middlemen and costs associated with regulatory clearances. As a result, it can help firms raise money at a much lower cost than current methods; and more investors can take part because it’s public.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Under the oversight of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the solution, which runs on the secure Microsoft cloud platform Azure, was recently used to enable online luxury retailer LuxDeco to issue ether-denominated bonds.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">In a world-first, Nivaura’s technology automated the creation of the necessary legal documents, the coordination of covenants, conditions, and book-building, the required e-signatures, the creation of the asset and money registers, delivery versus payment of the instrument and the ongoing management of the bonds, all on a public platform.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">JPMorgan, Allen &amp; Overy and Moody’s helped with Nivaura’s bond issue, which had a week-long maturity and paid 10% annual interest – a premium was added to manage volatility in the currency.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber inks its first mobile wallet deal in Southeast Asia</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Uber has inked its first payments deal in Southeast Asia after it announced a partnership with Vietnam-based mobile wallet service Momo.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Momo, which (raised $28 million led by Standard Chartered), will become a payment option inside the Uber app in Vietnam, alongside cash and credit cards. The app is the country’s top mobile payment service. It is used by 5 million people to pay bills, transport tickets and more.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The deal is the first of its kind for Uber in Southeast Asia, a region where it has a tough challenge battling Singapore-based Grab in seven markets and local unicorn Go-Jek in Indonesia.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Both Grab and Go-Jek have put a heavy focus on mobile payments, with each building a mobile wallet service of their own that will eventually go beyond paying for ride-sharing to pay for other goods. Go-Jek plans to spin out its Go-Pay service into a standalone app next year. Go-Jek may expand its reach outside of Indonesia using Go-Pay, rather than ride-sharing, as its initial launch service.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alibaba-Backed Paytm Aims to Become World's Largest Digital Bank</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Paytm Payments Bank aims to create the world’s largest digital bank with 500 million accounts, envisioning an online financial services provider of everything from wealth management to credit cards and stock market trading.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The bank is targeting people who don’t have access to professional financial services. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“We are unveiling our money market fund, launching our debit card and we’ll have the capabilities to allow enterprises to open business accounts,” Paytm Founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma said. “Digital payments was our entry point, we want to become a vertically-integrated financial services company.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Paytm was one of fewer than a dozen entities that secured permits to start payments banks, which can accept deposits and remittances but cannot lend.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The company will also operate a mobile-first bank with zero fees on online transactions and no minimum balance. Paytm Payments Bank is majority-owned by Sharma. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“We will launch share trading and insurance products very soon,” Sharma added. “We want to become an internet-age financial services company.”</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit Suisse Buys Majority Stake in FinTech Firm Tradeplus24</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit Suisse is backing a Swiss FinTech firm in Zurich which offers a receivables financing solution that is designed for SMEs. SVC-Ltd., the lender’s VC investment arm, has bought a majority stake in </span><a href="http://tradeplus24.ch/index.php/de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradeplus24</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The startup will use the new capital to further scale up support and delivery of its automated lending solution.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Credit Suisse plans to integrate Tradeplus24’s products in its own offering, which allows its clients to tap SMEs focused solution that offers a new simple way for companies to lend against their global accounts receivables. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Zurich has recently launched several initiatives to offer an attractive destination for entrepreneurs by way of venture capital and investors that support new ideas.</span></li>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese e-commerce colossus Tencent is an elephant in the room that is impossible not to talk about as the company </span><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/21/investing/tencent-facebook-value/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surpasses Facebook in value</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after a blockbuster year that saw its share price more than double. Tencent makes headlines on many accounts, including foreign high-caliber investments – earlier this year, it picked up a </span><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/08/technology/snap-tencent-snapchat/index.html?iid=EL"><span style="font-weight: 400;">12%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stake in Snap (the owner of Snapchat) and </span><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/29/technology/tencent-tesla-pony-ma-elon-musk/index.html?iid=EL"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in electric vehicle giant Tesla, aside from series of investments in startups across Asia. Investments, however, are not what I'd like to drill into this time.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tencent's WeChat and its scale</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tencent is probably best known for its mobile messenger WeChat (less for Tencent QQ, which was released in 1999 – 12 years earlier than WeChat), and rightfully so. </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradstone6/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brad Stone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luluchenyilun/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lulu Chen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Bloomberg, share that </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-06-28/tencent-rules-china-the-problem-is-the-rest-of-the-world"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than two-thirds of Chinese people use Tencent's two messaging apps, WeChat and QQ</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for everything from texting to shopping, flirting, dating, watching videos, playing games, and ordering food and taxis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Mary Meeker's 2017 Internet Trends report reveals that </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/wechat-captures-about-30-percent-of-chinas-mobile-app-usage-meeker-report.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">~900 million hours a day out of a total of ~3.1 billion hours of mobile app usage took place in WeChat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Collectively, Chinese users spend 1.7 billion hours a day on Tencent apps, which is more than they spend on all other apps combined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Released in 2011, WeChat now has close to 938 million active users, more than a third of whom spend in excess of four hours a day on the service, with half of the users spending </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tencent-wechat-china/with-new-mini-apps-wechat-seeks-even-more-china-clicks-idUSKCN18E38Z"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&gt;90 minutes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a day on the app. To put that in context, Stone and Chen share that the average person around the world spends a little more than an hour a day on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter combined.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How WeChat uses AI</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only are Tencent and its offsprings massive communications and commerce vehicles in China, but also, the company is making strides to leave Western competitors in the dust with its AI integrations.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source: </span></i><a href="http://ai.weixin.qq.com/#application"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat AI</span></i></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fcbgc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edward Bell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the CEO of FCB (Foote, Cone &amp; Belding) Greater China, describes some of </span><a href="https://www.warc.com/NewsAndOpinion/Opinion/2289"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the ways AI is used in WeChat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voice recognition is one of the biggest areas of everyday AI in action in WeChat. The company behind the technology is called </span><a href="https://www.chumenwenwen.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chumen Wenwen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (</span><a href="https://www.mobvoi.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobvoi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in En). The concept works in a similar way to Apple's Siri but with a built-in app that responds with more words and particularity in answers. The service links directly with third-party apps, enabling users to use voice to perform necessary actions in those apps.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">WeChat's virtual girlfriend app Xiaobing, which was developed by Microsoft and has an icon to type with, can have a conversation with the user. Users can even play 'guess who I am' game with her.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Translation capability – Translating Chinese is an extremely tricky task because Chinese data is all double-byte. WeChat allows to open up the translation account and paste or type in what needs to be translated, whether English or Chinese. Seconds later, the AI provides the answer, including alternative translations in case users don't agree with the AI's recommendation. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The Voice Donor – an initiative to have thousands of books voice-recorded for the blind. QR codes were put in the blank pages of books and the reader was invited to read a passage. The AI then intelligently edited all the passages together and 200,000 people's voices were put to use.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While all of it is impressive, one feature that I thought is just wonderfully brilliant is that apparently WeChat's 'shake your phone feature' is used to connect strangers who are shaking their phones at the same time. I don't know if anyone offers an easier way to connect digitally without having to memorize names to look them up later or having to type in names in different apps to find a person (that's if you can type names right in the first attempt). </span></p>
<p><a href="https://qz.com/974408/tencents-wechat-gives-it-an-advantage-in-the-global-artificial-intelligence-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat is perfectly positioned to get the AI game right</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (especially with its recent push into research via </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/27/tencent-ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Being a chat app, WeChat is able to collect countless messages each day that real people send to one another. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Conversational data is richer [than search or shopping data] because you have that many people on the platform performing that many interactions,” </span><a href="https://qz.com/974408/tencents-wechat-gives-it-an-advantage-in-the-global-artificial-intelligence-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tak Lo, Partner at Hong Kong-based AI startup accelerator </span><a href="https://www.zeroth.ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zeroth.ai</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Shopping and search engine data show one type of data, which is purchasing or shopping intent, which is valuable, but different. For example, if you were to build out a Natural Language Understanding engine, you would not use search engine data, because no one searches based on complete conversational phrases.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://qz.com/974408/tencents-wechat-gives-it-an-advantage-in-the-global-artificial-intelligence-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">QZ</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes that WeChat has an extra advantage: a significant portion of its users communicate using voice. Push-to-talk, a neglected feature in most countries, </span><a href="https://qz.com/443441/stop-texting-right-now-and-learn-from-the-chinese-theres-a-better-way-to-message/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has become a preferred method of chat for many users on WeChat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That means Tencent can draw not just from text but from recorded speech too by turning devices into walkie-talkies.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat as a business-driving vehicle</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While single-purpose apps in the US are struggling to gain traction partially because of exactly that – being </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/contextual-commerce-from-single-purpose-apps-to-all-in-one-platforms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">single-purpose</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Tencent made its apps a lifestyle choice by jamming multitude of use cases into a single platform. WeChat already serves as a one-stop-shop for everything from reading news and booking taxis to ordering takeaways and making payments. In fact, among the </span><a href="https://chinachannel.co/1017-wechat-report-users/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top reasons users are joining a WeChat group of 100+ users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is everything an average Western user does across separate proprietary solutions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Corporate internal communications </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Professional networking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Leisure and life (e.g. school colleagues)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Information sharing (e.g. online courses)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Entertainment-oriented (e.g. fan groups)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of groups – WeChat groups are very powerful marketing vehicles for e-retailers, whom the company doesn't even charge commissions or transaction fees. Especially popular and useful groups can bring money to their creators through membership fees (much like Instagram stars would collect ad money, but WeChat group owners can charge for membership in their groups).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat has a whole suite of </span><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/wiki?t=resource/res_main&amp;id=mp1496561283_bc5Rt"><span style="font-weight: 400;">instruments and instructions for official account platform developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which even includes WeChat Invoice, an e-invoicing capability. WeChat has released an electronic receipt General Solution Program to promote the usage and convenience of electronic receipts with the focus on users at the center, the company shares. WeChat has designed an ‘authorize first, swipe later’ billing and payments process in view of the different amounts of time that different vendors will need to issue a receipt. It decouples the two processes of the user's submission of a request and their receiving of the receipt. The receipt is guaranteed to make it to the user's account in a stable and reliable manner when the user is fully aware of what is going on.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat Pay</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat Pay is one of the cornerstones of WeChat's extensive capabilities. Used in China by 600 million people, the service takes advantage of Chinese banks’ low processing fees, allowing users to send very small monetary gifts called “Red Packets” to each other – a feature WeChat introduced in 2014 to exchange money electronically, based on the age-old Chinese custom of giving red envelopes filled with money at weddings, holidays, and special occasions, journalist </span><a href="https://evelinechao.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eveline Chao</span></a> <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3065255/china-wechat-tencent-red-envelopes-and-social-money"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. WeChat allows its users to send Packets of predetermined amounts to each other, either individually or in groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chao </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3065255/china-wechat-tencent-red-envelopes-and-social-money"><span style="font-weight: 400;">describes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the obsession with this digitally revived tradition the following way: "Say you have a chat group with five pals. You can put $5 in a red envelope and set it to disburse equally, so each friend gets $1. Alternatively, you could stipulate that the first two people to tap will get all the money in equal portions – $2.50 each – or that the first two people get a random cut, maybe $1 for one person and $4 for the other. The result is that any time a red envelope appears, people scramble to tap on it as fast as possible. (The packets expire in a day, adding to the time pressure.) Only afterward do they see how much money they’ve won, giving it an addictive element of surprise. So addictive, in fact, that third-party apps now exist that let users grab red envelopes without unlocking their phones."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The journalist also shares that in the last Chinese New Year, &gt;420 million WeChat users sent a total of 32 billion red envelopes (10X increase from 2015). More impressively, </span><a href="http://www.scmp.com/tech/article/1913340/wechat-red-envelopes-help-drive-online-payments-use-china"><span style="font-weight: 400;">409,000 of them were sent in a single second</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, just after midnight on the first night of the holiday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other, more generic, </span><a href="https://chinachannel.co/1017-wechat-report-users/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">situations of WeChat Pay use</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Supermarket and convenience stores – 28.9%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Online shopping – 26%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Restaurants and food – 21.6%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Malls – 20%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Utility fees – 14.2%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Transportation and travel – 13.2%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Entertainment and leisure – 8%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Public departments – 4.3%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Beauty and fitness salons – 4.2%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Hospitals – 2.8%</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/GrgoireTHIEBAULT/wechat-bible-for-brands-v1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">functionality of the super app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is nothing short of impressive. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat mini-programs and developer tools </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat also operates its own developer platform with </span><a href="https://chinachannel.co/1017-wechat-report-users/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">200,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> third-party developers that are making everything imaginable and unimaginable to keep users glued to the platform. WeChat even offers </span><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/wiki?t=resource/res_main&amp;id=mp1455784134"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeUI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – is a set of basic style library consistent with WeChat native visual experience, officially designed by the WeChat Design Team, tailor-made for WeChat Web development and WeChat mini-programs, in order to improve and standardize the experience for WeChat users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat rivals Google and Apple developer platforms with its WeChat JS-SDK – </span><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/loginpage?t=wxm2-login&amp;lang=zh_CN"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat public platform </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with WeChat in-app based web development toolkits for web developers. Through using WeChat JS-SDK, web developers can effectively use the capabilities of mobile phone systems to take pictures, select pictures, voices, and locations. Also to use WeChat's unique capabilities such as WeChat sharing, scanning, card, payment to provide WeChat users better quality Web experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would be pointless to list dozens of extensive capabilities WeChat enables, they can be found with clear instructions in </span><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/wiki?t=resource/res_main&amp;id=mp1445241432"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat Official Account Platform Documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why the Swiss Army knife?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In tier one Chinese cities (the most developed cities like Beijing, Shanghai etc.), WeChat’s penetration rate is around 93%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"To get an understanding of the current capabilities of WeChat, and why it is so popular in China, imagine WhatsApp combined with Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Skype, Tinder, eBay, PayPal, Uber, Google Maps, Slack, Apple Pay and many more apps used by western consumers. WeChat allows users to do everything from communicating with friends, staying up to date with the news or celebrities, booking doctors’ appointments, hailing a ride or paying bills. All of this is done without ever having to leave the app. &lt;...&gt; </span><b>For companies that are looking to the Chinese market, no matter who your customer is, they’re on WeChat. All of your Chinese competitors... They’re on WeChat too. Not being on WeChat places you a step behind in the increasingly competitive Chinese market.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">" – </span><a href="http://maicapital.com/news/wechat-explained"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAI Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an Australian Investment Group focused on investing in companies looking to expand into China.</span></p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annual worldwide AI revenue is projected to grow from $644 million in 2016 to </span><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160825006052/en/Artificial-Intelligence-Revenue-Reach-36.8-Billion-Worldwide"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$37 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 2025, with </span><a href="https://www.top500.org/news/market-for-artificial-intelligence-projected-to-hit-36-billion-by-2025/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top use cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> including algorithmic trading strategy performance improvement; static image recognition, classification, and tagging; efficient, scalable processing of patient data; predictive maintenance; content distribution on social media; and much more. </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/how-banks-regulators-are-applying-machine-learning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning is extensively applied by financial institutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/ai-most-defining-technology-banking-industry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI is becoming the most defining technology in banking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Furthermore, AI is expected to have a strong impact on the FinTech community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With data being the primary force behind AI advancement, international corporations in the years ahead will be competing for the dominance in this segment. Meanwhile, the startup community will be a major beneficiary as tech giants are </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/democratization-of-advanced-technologies-building-ai-that-can-build-ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">democratizing AI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How AI Is Changing FinTech</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investment in FinTech organizations rose by approximately 10% to just over $23 billion in 2016 alone. Here are some ways in which AI is playing a major part in changing FinTech:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Increasing security: Because AI helps by analyzing larger volumes of security data and is also able to scale to the size of a company as it grows, this technology can aid organizations in identifying: fraudulent behavior; suspicious transactions; potential future attacks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Reducing processing times</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Reducing duplicate expenses and human error</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Increasing levels of automation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Offering game-changing insights</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Empowering smaller companies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Balancing consumer budgets based on spending patterns</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Chatbots in financial services are: driving more seamless shopping; taking orders directly from social media channels; editing and checking bank account details; supervising consumer credit score; informing consumers of upcoming payments; and helping consumers to create realistic budgets.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-ai-is-changing-fintech_us_5a1c4e9ce4b0e580b35371e0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial Intelligence is Transforming Sales In Surprising Ways</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Too much of a salesperson’s daily activity is spent on tedious and monotonous tasks like cold calling, prospecting, responding to email, etc. Meanwhile, 40% of time spent on sales-related activities can be automated by adapting current technologies with AI. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">By embedding AI into CRM databases, salesforce automation software, help desk solutions, and other B2B apps, a lot of the crippling rote tasks still performed by salespeople can be eliminated. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The effects include decreased cognitive load, increased job satisfaction, and stronger overall rapport and relationships across the sales organization.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">AI helps salespeople increase lead quantity as well as quality. Companies using AI for sales were able to increase leads by 50%. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">AI has the potential to transform salespeople into marketers’ most trusted advisors by doing the ‘heavy lifting and determining which leads represent the best targets for inbound and outbound marketing initiatives. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">AI enables salespeople to more effectively engage with customers. Prescriptive AI solutions deliver much more than predictive scores. They provide insight into why one prospect is more lucrative than another.

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baidu and Xiaomi are working together on Internet-of-Things and artificial intelligence</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Baidu and Xiaomi have announced a strategic partnership to tackle two emerging technologies: IoT and AI.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The two firms said will immediately explore opportunities in voice recognition, deep learning, and computer vision, in addition to more work with DuerOS. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Further to that, Baidu’s tech reach also extends into robotics, AR, VR and self-driving cars, which could also be areas of joint cooperation in the future for Xiaomi.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Baidu has favored a partnership based approach with hardware makers to get DuerOS and other technology into the hands of consumers. The company doesn’t charge a license fee for the OS – the same applies to this Xiaomi deal – and it claims to work with 130 companies that cover smartphones, smart TVs, smartwatches and home appliances.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barclays is building a retail bank in the US</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Barclaycard in the US is building a digital bank and will rebrand itself as Barclays next year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The credit card issuer, a division of British bank Barclays, has been targeting prime and super-prime borrowers with an online personal loan it has been quietly offering on a test-and-learn basis to a small group of customers since last November. It plans to launch that offering publicly by the middle of 2018. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">This year, the company also began testing a personal financial management tool in its credit card app called My Personal Bank, which aggregates customers’ Barclays’ credit cards, personal loans and savings products – as well as accounts with other banks – into a single place. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Barclaycard is morphing its business into a more complete suite of digital banking offerings at a time when FinTech startups and online banking products are starting to look more and more similar. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Chase introduced Finn this year, an app for people who would rather skip the branches for completely mobile checking and savings accounts with personal finance tools; and Wells Fargo announced a similar offering called Greenhouse, a standalone mobile banking app with digital-only accounts and personal finance features.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Barclaycard launched in the US in 2004 as one of the earliest digital-only banks, though it only offered savings accounts and CDs. Today, it’s the ninth largest US card issuer, with $26 billion in card loans and $12 billion in online deposits.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Internet Has Altered the Meaning of “Truth” and “Trust”</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Tech companies will enter a new era of accountability. The idea that the likes of Uber, Facebook, and Amazon are immune to regulation, tax, and compliance, that they’re just these disruptive pathways that connect people and resources, I think those days are over. There will be a sweeping wave of regulation that looks at platforms’ responsibilities to reduce the risk of bad things happening and also, how they respond when things go wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some institutions will use this period of change an opportunity – proving to society that we need institutions, that they present norms and rules and systems, and they can be trustworthy."

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financial services industry is no stranger to machine learning – a number of large institutions continue to successfully implement the technology across such </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2016/06/04/machine-learning-is-redefining-the-enterprise-in-2016/#2a65c5b01871"><span style="font-weight: 400;">areas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as risk analytics and regulation, customer segmentation, cross-selling and upselling, sales and marketing campaign management, creditworthiness evaluation. Among institutions that are applying machine learning are BBVA, JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, OCBC, and many more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Credit applications and underwriting are the </span><a href="https://igniteoutsourcing.com/publications/machine-learning-in-finance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">key areas where machine learning, and data analytics in general, will have an initial impact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

The banks have achieved these gains by devising new recommendation engines for clients in retailing and in small and medium-sized companies. They have also built micro-targeted models that more accurately forecast who will cancel service or default on their loans, and how best to intervene, the consultancy says.</span></p>

<td style="width: 581px;">Cristóbal Sepúlveda, Technical Architect at BBVA, exposed an actual use case of this technology: “At BBVA, we developed a service recommendation engine for bank users. With this proposal, what we are trying to do is offer the best commercial offer depending on the most used transactions by the user and their navigation patterns.<br />
All this information is processed in a classification algorithm which then generates a recommendation. “The volume of information is incredibly vast and the only way to offer a recommendation is using machine learning technologies,” he noted.

<td style="width: 165px;"><b>JPMorgan Chase</b></td>
<td style="width: 581px;">At JPMorgan Chase, a learning machine is parsing financial deals that once kept legal teams busy for thousands of hours. The program, called COIN (Contract Intelligence), does the job of interpreting commercial-loan agreements that, until the project went<br />
online in June 2016, consumed 360,000 hours of work each year by lawyers and loan officers. The software reviews documents in seconds, is less error-prone and never asks for vacation. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Made possible by investments in machine learning and a new private cloud network, COIN is just the start for JPMorgan Chase. The firm set up technology hubs for teams specializing in big data, robotics and cloud infrastructure to find new sources of revenue while reducing expenses and risks. The system already is helping the bank automate some coding activities and making its 20,000 developers more productive, saving money.<br />
When needed, the firm can also tap into outside cloud services from Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-28/jpmorgan-marshals-an-army-of-developers-to-automate-high-finance">Read more here. </a> </span></td>

monitoring, in addition to increasing the bank’s operational efficiency and accuracy in the detection of suspicious transactions.<br />
OCBC Bank has conducted a PoC with ThetaRay. Now, the company plans to start an extended PoC and a pre-implementation phase. The algorithm will detect anomalies in transactional behavior by evaluating broad parameters such as products, customers, and risks, instead of looking at each transaction as a standalone. In the PoC stage, the technology was deployed to analyze one year’s worth of OCBC Bank’s corporate banking transaction data. The findings demonstrated that it decreased the number of alerts, which did not require further review, by 35%. <a href="http://riskmanagement.banking-business-review.com/news/ocbc-bank-to-use-ai-and-machine-learning-to-combat-financial-crimes-091117-5967954">Read more here. </a></td>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right partnerships will define success stories across industries. The insurance and financial services industries are the ones to benefit the most as it becomes clear that technology companies can bring efficiency into processes and redefine business models.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">InsurTech Is Hitting Critical Mass</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched in 2013, Chinese non-life insurer ZhongAn has already reached a market cap of $13.6 billion on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where it started trading in late September this year. ZhongAn uses artificial intelligence and big data to generate mass market sales over the internet. Its flagship product is a policy that covers the cost of returning products bought on shopping platform Taobao.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ZhongAn has sold over 7 billion policies to 490 million customers so far. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">InsurTech startups represent 15% of the $50 billion invested in the global FinTech arena during the 2010-15 period.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the insurance products have become commoditized, driving prices and margins down. For example, 70% of people renewing their car insurance policy in the UK use price-comparison sites. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaborative win-win opportunities in the upstream part of the supply chain are possible for insurers and startups alike. For example, Shift Technology provides AI solutions for insurance fraud detection and automated claims management. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promising segments for market growth/disruption include mobile POS (e.g. inexpensive insurance for shipping return, flight delay, cracked phone screen), group healthcare and automated claims management. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional insurers quick to leverage the relevant startup services while defining a digital vision for themselves might be able to thrive.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Machine Learning Truly Applies To Digital Identity</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two broad categories of ML models are clustering (unsupervised learning) and classification (supervised learning). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clustering is the grouping of similar data into groups, where data in the same group is more closely related to each other than to data in other groups. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classification is the process of identifying which label a new observation belongs to, knowing the classification of observations from a fact-based training data set. This method can be used to generate a predictive model to associate multiple advertising identifiers to one consumer or a household. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most effective digital identity solution comes from utilizing a hybrid of these two models. Semi-supervised learning leverages advantages from both clustering and classification algorithms to achieve higher accuracy. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In semi-supervised learning, a small amount of labeled data is used along with unlabeled data as the training data set for the model. With this approach, the quality, freshness and statistical relevance of the labeled data can be managed. Another advantage of utilizing this model is to perform household identification using classification techniques with labeled data across household devices and then clustering these household devices into individual groups with significantly smaller labeled data sets.</span></li>

                <title>The Secret Sauce</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/fintech/insights/mobile/transactions/2017/11/28/the-secret-sauce/</link>
                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a historical basis for establishing that money – fiat, commodity or otherwise – is a state-backed utility. And for good reason! What is more important is the understanding and agreement that this has to become the basis of evolving cashless from cash rather than cash-replacement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The secret sauce to get us to the holy grail of ubiquitous m-transactions – for finance, retail, health and government applications – can be summarized into the following five guiding principles:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Commerce has evolved on several fronts. The marketplace is truly multidimensional and global with large but nevertheless cliques, and hence, its own set of challenges. Channels continue to evolve as do the means of access, and while the fundamental constructs of commerce remain the same, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">new transaction rails will have to ensure frictionless cash-in and cash-out</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> despite our intent on moving towards a cashless environment. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Even with an expanded definition, m-transactions will continue to evolve around buyers and sellers, around credentials and tokens, and around privacy and identity. Underscoring all of this expansion and evolution will be the ePlumbing, or stated differently, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">an authorization infrastructure based on a universally accepted but distributed form of identity that is capable of issuing and settling a multitude of tokens – permanent and temporary – for finance, retail, health, education, and government applications across all channels, devices, and data elements</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If we get this ePlumbing wrong, everything else we try to build on top of it will not stand the test of time.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. With all the great technological progress and the overarching potential and promise of m-transactions, we continue to struggle with figuring out how to drive adoption. We have been guaranteed the wrong answers, as we have consistently failed to ask the right questions – questions we believe that should be framed around the overall experience to help</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">simplify the experience by</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> leveraging contextual and behavioral intelligence, where applications lead transactions to help achieve a seamless experience across all channels and devices</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Other questions that we will need to address as we try to answer the above are: “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What exactly is the seamless experience?”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the most effective way of ensuring that an individual’s privacy becomes the responsibility of the entire community</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?”</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. While usability will drive adoption, the utility will ensure scale. The exercise we now need to undertake is of finding the fine line that will demarcate the utility from the usability. Once we do that, we can effectively </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">define and deploy a cross-industry utility that will ensure scale, upon which a highly innovative usability environment can then help drive adoption, collectively addressing all the relevant technology, business, and regulatory issues related to seamless personalized transactions</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of us will revel in the trees and some of us will enjoy taking on the entire forest. What we can state decisively is that we will need both: the deep domain experts as well as the broad visionaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is also interesting is as we step back and connect all of these dots, the picture starts to look very different. A true cashless environment is achievable provided we perceive it to be so, for the objects of sense exist only when they are perceived. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, the real issue is one of perception.</span></p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://sp17.nextmoney.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next Money Global Conference Edition São Paulo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> held at the beginning of November (the only one in Latin America), brought together entrepreneurs, technology, and financial companies, specialists and investors. One of the most commented themes in various panels, even when it was not the main theme, was blockchain, which also relates to the themes of other panels, such as cryptocurrency and ICO (Initial Coin Offering). Executives of the companies like </span><a href="https://latoex.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latoex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://consensys.net/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consensys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.r3.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">R3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.coinbr.net/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinBR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://foxbit.exchange/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foxbit,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://alphaledger.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alpha Ledger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> participated in these discussions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who wanted to know more about the financial innovations produced in the country had a full day with the presentation of the FinTech competitors in the FF18 (besides, of course, the FinTechs participating in the panels, which are already relevant in their sectors). In the panels were companies such as </span><a href="http://www.creditas.com.br/%E2%80%8E"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creditas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.zetrasoft.com.br/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zetra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (credit), </span><a href="https://beetech.global/en.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beetech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (currency exchange and remittances), </span><a href="https://foxbit.exchange/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foxbit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> e </span><a href="https://www.coinbr.net/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinBR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Bitcoin). The panels were moderated by </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-diniz-a9540a11/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno Diniz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Co-founder of </span><a href="http://www.spiralem.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spiralem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelo-bradaschia-937100/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcelo Bradaschia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christina-orssich-hutchinson-b857019/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christina Hutchinson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were also among the participating experts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the panel on ICO's, Fernando Bresslau, Country Manager of </span><a href="https://www.ripio.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ripio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Brazil (formerly BitPagos, from Argentina), shared the case of the company. Ripio raised the equivalent of US $32 million with its token, based on the cryptocurrency Ethereum, which was sold in early November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brazilian FinTechs </span><a href="https://www.swapy.network/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swapy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://originalmy.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OriginalMY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have already released their white papers – documents detailing the process of issuing tokens and the company plans for the investment received – for their ICOs that are expected to happen soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the apparent market excitement with blockchain technology, Edilson Osório Jr., CEO of OriginalMY argues that its use should be considered on a case-by-case basis. "The question is if you can do today without being on blockchain. If you can do that, you don’t have to do it on blockchain," he explained.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional companies and innovation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional companies show that they are not only following but also developing innovative initiatives internally. This is the case, for example, of Banco do Brasil, which has made some of its open banking projects available to Beta customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Pedro Begotti from Banco do Brasil, there are also initiatives mapped on the institution's innovation platform that have not yet been launched, and many will be launched shortly. "The structure we have built in the bank is already complete. What is missing is a change in the business model," Begotti added, talking about how innovations can change the role of large banks in the dynamics of the financial market in the country. Banks would have to adapt their business model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commenting on open banking, Microsoft's Head of Financial Services Adriano Bottas, brought up the European model, known as PSD2, as an example. "More than a 360º view of your customer, it allows you to have a 720º view, with the authorization of the client, through the exchange of data between institutions," he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speakers agreed that the exchange of data can benefit customers who will have an offer of more services geared to their needs. In addition, open banking reduces risks to the institutions, which will have more information about consumers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">FF18 – Global Competition for Financial Innovation</span></h2>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-Thanksgiving week has been rich on interesting updates across sectors, some of which represent a significant push in adopting new technology, embracing startup partnerships, and expansions into new niches and markets.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lending updates</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeking bigger US presence, Barclays joins crowded online lending market</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">As part of a broader effort to build out its US consumer business, London-based Barclays is now offering unsecured personal loans online, targeting prime and super-prime borrowers. It has been testing its online lending platform with select US customers since late last year and plans to roll it out in full force in 2018.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Barclays’ personal loans typically range between $5,000 and $35,000 and can be repaid in three, four or five years. The interest rates range from 4.99% to 18.99% and the loans carry no origination fees or prepayment penalties.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The bank has made roughly 15,000 personal loans to date. The consumers Barclays is targeting are interested in using the loans for things like debt consolidation and home improvements.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Barclays has made the entire process – from application to funding – entirely digital and gives borrowers near-instant decisions on loan applications. It is also adding its own features, like giving borrowers (or prospective borrowers) access to a customer service representative should they need help during the loan process.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">In China, Unsecured Short-Term Lending Now a Trillion-Yuan Industry</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The unsecured short-term loans in China are ballooning – these loans have already surpassed the 1 trillion yuan ($151 billion) mark. It is projected that the total amount of unsecured short-term loans in 2017 is set to be six times more than in 2016.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Credit risks are building up, as borrowers have been found taking out loans from one lender to roll over previous loans from another, snowballing their debt. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">As of Sunday, there were 2,693 online platforms offering short-term loans to nearly 10 million clients. The average size of such a loan was 1,400 yuan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Most “cash loan” platforms, defined as those that offer unsecured loans with loan periods of six months or less, charge annualized rates of interest that exceed 100% despite advertising seemingly low daily interest rates.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Two million clients have taken out loans from more than one platform in the same month. Half a million of these borrowers took out loans from more than 10 platforms within the same month. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Because of easy access to loans, clients are typically low-income individuals that find it difficult to get loans from the formal banking system. Threats and even violence are often used to claim outstanding loans.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">1,044 platforms for short-term unsecured loans operated through websites, 860 through WeChat public accounts, and 429 through apps.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Nearly 600 P2P websites also offered unsecured short-term loans, accounting for about 16% of all P2P platforms. This compares with 812 online lending platforms that offered unsecured short-term loans, making up about 37% of all online lending platforms.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payments updates</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers can now invoice buyers through PayPal’s new chat extension for Messenger</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">PayPal and Facebook are expanding their integrations with the launch of an extension for Messenger that allows PayPal sellers to invoice buyers directly through private messaging. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch comes on the heels of </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/20/you-can-now-paypal-friends-in-messenger-and-get-help-via-chat/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last month’s debut of P2P PayPal payments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Messenger, and the arrival of PayPal’s first customer service Messenger bot for handling customer questions and requests for help.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">With this integration, the focus is on shifting small business transactions and those between buyers and sellers into Messenger.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank of America's P2P Payments Business Almost Doubled in October</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Zelle processed $1.5 billion worth of payments in October. That was up 90% from the same month last year. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">There are now 2.5 million active users of Zelle, with thousands more signing on every day.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">At the end of Q3 2017, BofA had 23.6 million active users of its mobile app. The volume of mobile check deposits made on the app corresponds to the work of 1,100 branches. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Digital banking products are much more efficient for Bank of America to provide. Since Moynihan took the reins at the beginning of 2010, the bank has cut its annual expenses from $70 billion down to $55 billion in 2016. Last year, the bank vowed to drop its yearly operating costs to $53 billion by 2018.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Q3 2017 was the second quarter in a row that the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank turned in a lower efficiency ratio than the notoriously efficient Wells Fargo. </span></li>
</ul>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">China’s WeChat Pay comes to London</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">WeChat Pay, the mobile payment platform — an extension of Tencent's messaging app WeChat — comes to UK (the north London market is popular with Chinese tourists). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">SafeCharge, a company that helps businesses process payments, took notice and has updated its POS software accordingly. Now, stall owners can accept WeChat Pay with a tablet and compatible till.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Camden is the first place in the UK to accept WeChat Pay at the point-of-sale.</span></li>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LTP Team had the pleasure of speaking with </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-e-tavares-534201aa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juan E. Tavares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Co-founder &amp; Chief Strategy Officer at </span><a href="https://www.lendingpoint.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LendingPoint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Juan works to distill stories from data, leverage investor relations, and nurture new opportunities in the lending market. Seizing the opportunity to bring LendingPoint to the American market, Juan points to the economy’s reshaping of the financial services industry, resulting in new regulatory environments for lenders and new challenges for consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope you enjoy our conversation with Juan as much as we did.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><i>Photo: </i><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-e-tavares-534201aa/"><i>Juan E. Tavares</i></a><i>, Co-founder &amp; Chief Strategy Officer at LendingPoint</i></strong></p>
<p><b>LTP Team: Juan, please tell us about yourself.</b></p>
<p><b>Juan E. Tavares: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe FinTech is the ultimate tool for financial inclusion and upward mobility – the solutions that arise at the intersection of data and technology have the potential to level the playing field financially for underserved segments of the population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helping entrepreneurs tap into unlocked potential was my first experience with FinTech. As the US economy fell to its knees after the ’08 crisis, my partner Victor Pacheco and I were contacted by CAN Capital to help them scale their technology beyond the US borders. We formed a partnership that launched Avanzame Latin America, headquartered in the Dominican Republic, in the Spring of 2010. The organization grew to become the most successful SMB lender in the Caribbean and was recently acquired by Banco Popular Dominicano. Since the acquisition, the bank has continued to leverage the platform to democratize access to credit for entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, I moved to the United States from the Dominican Republic to co-founded </span><a><span style="font-weight: 400;">LendingPoint,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alongside my partners Victor Pacheco, Tom Burnside, and Franck Fatras. We’re back at it again, this time around helping consumers whose credit story is not understood by other lenders. We’ve chosen to serve the “NearPrime” market, which consists of nearly 50 million Americans with credit scores between 600 and 700, who have essentially fallen victim to the market’s slow response to help them tap into their potential.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP Team: Give us a paragraph pitch for your company.</b></p>
<p><b>Juan E. Tavares:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> LendingPoint is a FinTech balance sheet lender with a vision to revolutionize access to credit – by leveling the playing field for the NearPrime borrower and democratizing access to credit. There are three critical things to understand about our company:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We chose to listen to the voice of the NearPrime borrower because it is a segment of the market that has been both underserved and misunderstood, and because our business exists to expand access to credit;</span></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the marketplace lender, our balance sheet approach means that we maintain credit risk and the relationship with the consumer, so we’re encouraged to lend more responsibly;</span></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are credit-first: we have been quietly building out the systems, technology, credit models, and partner networks necessary to win in the marketplace because we focus on sound credit practices first and foremost. Our unique, credit first approach to lending uses data and technology to tell credit stories about borrowers who other lenders don’t understand. Our algorithms look beyond a credit score, focusing on both on the relationship with the individual and the future potential while looking for more reasons to say “yes.”</span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>LTP Team: In a sentence or two, what problems are you solving today?</b></p>
<p><b>Juan E. Tavares:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> LendingPoint provides access to affordable credit for these NearPrime consumers, helping them to build and improve their credit profiles. There is a great divide that happens at the 700 FICO score. Access to credit is no problem for so-called Prime customers with scores above 700 – they get the lowest interest rates and the best reward programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the rest of the population, the story is different – they don’t qualify for traditional bank loans, and a lot of times, they’re left with little to no options beyond predatory lenders, expensive subprime products, and sky-high interest rates. LendingPoint provides access to affordable credit for these NearPrime consumers, helping them to build and improve their credit profiles. </span></p>
<p><b>LTP Team: Who are you selling to?</b></p>
<p><b>Juan E. Tavares: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We offer loans to NearPrime consumers – people with credit scores between 600 and 700. We have identified unique behavior patterns that bring these consumers together as one asset class: some may be working-class Americans, and others may be millennials looking to establish credit for the first time. We look at creditworthiness beyond their FICO scores, discovering characteristics that are more distinctive and tell a broader story about a person’s potential, not just their past. So whether they’re planning a dream vacation or a dream wedding; a home renovation or a cross-country move; or need access to money for debt consolidation or medical expenses – LendingPoint offers transparent terms that take the guesswork out of repayment.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP Team: How does LendingPoint differentiate from competitors?</b></p>
<p><b>Juan E. Tavares: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of today’s FinTech lenders are “capital-light and credit last.” As a credit-first FinTech balance sheet lender, a constellation of differences sets LendingPoint apart. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While other alternative lenders focus primarily on customer acquisition and front-end user experience (with credit fundamentals being secondary), LendingPoint is a credit-first lender. We never lose sight of the fundamentals of sound credit modeling. This approach allows us to approve more creditworthy customers and provide lower, more transparent rates than our competitors (14.9%-35% APR) – all while achieving lower charge-off rates, lower cost of acquisition, and higher profitability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, LendingPoint is a balance sheet lender, which means that we maintain the credit risk and the relationship with the borrower (vs. the marketplace model, where the loans are originated for third-party investors). We have a vested interest in making sure the loan performs – so with us, consumers get better, more transparent terms, and investors see better returns. There is a real alignment of interest that is rarely seen in alternative lending.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP Team: Your next milestone?</b></p>
<p><b>Juan E. Tavares:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In </span><a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/03/prweb14123513.htm#!"><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnership with FinWise Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we are continuing to expand our services nationwide with standardized rates, loan agreements, product portfolios, marketing, and services. We’re now operational in 30 states plus the District of Columbia, and we’re continuing to expand nationwide. This gives us a great platform for building partnerships with other entities that have a similar customer strategy – companies that are on a mission to help consumers who’ve been left behind by traditional banking services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because we’ve done the hard work of becoming a successful credit-first, balance sheet lender, we can now solve the credit problem for many companies at the point of access where their consumers need it. So, we’re busy exploring partnerships with retailers, small businesses, and other lending marketplaces to expand our point of need strategy. Our goal is to meet people at the point where they want or need access to credit – whether they’re on a home improvement site shopping for an upcoming renovation; planning a wedding, or even building a business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent example of this type of partnership is a new product we just announced with ezVerify, called ezCarePoint. ezCarePoint helps patients verify their insurance coverage and payment responsibility for healthcare services before the procedures take place, preventing incidents where patients unexpectedly find themselves responsible for bills outside of their insurance coverage. If the patient can’t pay the out-of-pocket costs up front, they can apply for a loan &amp; payment plan quickly and easily from the ezCarePoint platform. Patients are notified of approvals in a matter of seconds, and the loan proceeds are paid directly to the medical practitioners to pay the patients’ out-of-pocket medical costs when the treatment is rendered or procedure performed. We think this product has the potential to solve the last mile problem in medical payments, and there are so many more examples of how we can provide access to credit to consumers in the moments they need it most.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP Team: What do you envision for the future of alternative finance?</b></p>
<p><b>Juan E. Tavares: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech is here to stay, but the landscape will continue to evolve. After the Great Recession, tech-enabled lenders stepped in to meet the growing customer demand for credit, but they didn’t have a credit-first model, and for the past decade not a single one has brought a solution to market that takes care of customers as well as investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These “capital-light, credit-last” tech-enabled platforms have proven not to be sustainable on a standalone basis, and thus, I think they will continue to fall out of favor with investors. Instead, the market will reward three things:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Unique origination channels at the point-of-need;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Credit performance; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Profitability.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech Balance Sheet Lenders like LendingPoint are in the best position to deliver on this trifecta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past 10 years, some have said that FinTech’s promise was to help in the recovery of the consumers and the economy by displacing banks; this clearly has not happened, and I don’t believe it would or should. Instead, the next 10 years will be about a “Great Conversion,” where FinTech companies – those that serve unique markets, with robust credit disciplines and sustainable business models – will become attractive partners for banks. I envision an ecosystem of greater collaboration between FinTech innovation and traditional banking, not an ongoing competition between incumbents and disruptors.</span></p>

                <title>Daily Review: Meet the Pioneers That Enable Access to Their Banking App Through Iris Scanning</title>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the culture of convenience pushes boundaries across segments, banking sees accelerating adoption of biometrics as the way to access personal accounts – Spanish heavyweight BBVA inches closer to Samsung to bring the biometric authentication on Android devices to its banking app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">BBVA, the first bank with access to its mobile app via iris scanning, thanks to Samsung</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">On Nov. 16, 2017, Samsung and BBVA presented the iris scanning feature, which will allow BBVA customers with Samsung-compatible smartphones to log on to the bank’s Spanish mobile banking app just by looking at their displays.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">BBVA becomes the first Spanish bank to deploy Samsung’s advanced biometric authentication technology, Samsung Pass, which will permit customers to bypass cumbersome login/password authentication methods. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Iris recognition is currently considered to be the most secure form of identity verification.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Samsung Pass, based on FIDO (Fast Identity Online) technology, frees the user from having to write identifiers and passwords to start each session. </span></li>

<hr />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BBVA is not really the first bank to allow users access to their accounts through iris scan. This year, </span><a href="http://finovate.com/samsung-power-biometric-authentication-pilot-bank-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank of America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/2017/09/biometric-banking-how-to-log-into-your-bank-account-with-your-eyes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TBS bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are also on one stage or the other with adopting similar technology for app access.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biometrics to replace PIN code in Nigeria</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has disclosed that with the Bank Verification Number (BVN) in place, biometrics will soon be used for transactions on the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) instead of the existing PIN code.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">"That means if you want to transact with your ATM, you will need to use your biometrics. There is no way you can give your finger to a third party. If that is enabling, it will make our system to be more secure and make all our transactions to be validated."</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Senior officials also said &gt;90,000 military pensioners in Nigeria are to be identified as part of a national biometric verification exercise.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credence Research forecasts biometrics in healthcare market growth</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The global healthcare biometrics market will grow at a CAGR of 22.9% to surpass $13.9 million in revenue in 2025.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Demand is increasing for optimum certainty in patient identification to reduce healthcare fraud while protecting patient data privacy and security. In combination with increasing concern about cybersecurity, this is driving growth in the use of IT applications for healthcare, as well as the development and deployment of biometric technologies catering to the healthcare industry.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voice Biometrics, Phone and Network Imaging – A Magic Mix for Intelligent Authentication</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Eckoh, the London-based provider of global payment products and customer service solutions, will be awarded a patent that combines voice biometrics with phone ‘footprinting.’</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">When one considers that a phone ‘footprint’ is also regarded as a unique template, very much like a biometric template (voice, finger, face, etc.), this combination of factors actually satisfies all three criteria: 1) Multi-layer – speaker and device, both components that make up the ‘edge’ of a connection; 2) Multi-modal – voice and phone ‘biometrics’; 3) Multi-factor – something you are (voice) and something you ‘have’ (phone).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The application of Big Data Analytics on various network components such as the SIM card (the primary network authentication layer), phone, carrier network(s), internal enterprise systems and other nodes across the entire voice ecosystem is yielding immense improvements in caller authentication. AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon announced in September that they have joined their considerable resources to create the Mobile Authentication Taskforce, whose goal to develop mobile authentication solutions using components such as network-based device authentication, geo-location and SIM card recognition.</span></li>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MEDICI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data, Germany’s FinTech landscape counts ~475 companies. While FinTech companies in Germany collected €400 million for the whole of 2016, the inflow of capital had already reached €307 million in H1 2017. The number of deals also went up, as did the average size of the deals, rising from €7 million to €7.3 million, </span><a href="https://frankfurt-main-finance.com/en/fintech-location-germany-set-for-growth/%5C"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankfurt Main Finance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the financial center initiative for Frankfurt am Main, reports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The full market potential for FinTechs in Germany is estimated at €1.7 trillion (€380 billion in financings and €1.3 trillion in wealth management). Of this market, FinTechs are expected to catch relatively moderate €58 billion in 2020, €97 billion in 2025, and €148 billion in 2035 (base case), according to the </span><a href="http://financialinstitutions.bakermckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2017/06/Baker_McKenzie-Fintech_regulation_comparison_June2017.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Comparative FinTech Overview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in June 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The edition emphasizes that the regions of Berlin and Rhine-Main-Neckar (led by Frankfurt) in particular are consolidating their status as FinTech hotspots within Germany. In fact, in November 2016, the </span><a href="https://frankfurt-main-finance.com/en/german-government-appoints-financial-centre-frankfurt-digital-hub-for-fintech/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">German federal government designated the Financial Center Frankfurt the digital hub for FinTech and financial services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of their greater digital hubs initiative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As part of the national IT summit in November 2016, the German federal government named Frankfurt one of five digital hubs across Germany. The Frankfurt digital hub focuses on the financial services and FinTech industries and is supported by Darmstadt, whose focus is on cybersecurity,” the Ministry of Economics, Energy, Transport &amp; Regional Development emphasizes in the </span><a href="https://frankfurt-main-finance.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HTI17021-Fintech-170427_highres.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brochure reviewing Germany’s leading FinTech ecosystem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source: Axon FinTech</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Frankfurt’s strong appeal to banks makes the region even more interesting for FinTechs,” </span><a href="https://frankfurt-main-finance.com/en/fintech-location-germany-set-for-growth/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hubertus-v%C3%A4th-11976557/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hubertus Väth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Managing Director of Frankfurt Main Finance. “The EU’s leading financial center is well-placed to attract FinTechs and become a leading location for young, innovative and agile companies. It is a matter of further enhancing the location’s appeal to FinTechs. Frankfurt and the Rhine-Main-Neckar region are facing global competition, and for the foreseeable future, London is likely to remain the benchmark in Europe against which company founders will judge us. In particular, we still need to improve in terms of our openness to cooperation with company founders, the social acceptance of failure and subsequent new starts, and the tax treatment of venture capital losses sustained.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://frankfurt-main-finance.com/en/financial-centre/advantages-of-the-location/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankfurt is home to the European Central Bank and more than 200 banks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (of which 161 are foreign). The Rhine-Main Region is one of Europe’s strongest economic regions and home to top-class higher education and research institutions. More than </span><a href="https://www.invest-in-hessen.com/mm/16_03_17_DaZa_2016_EN_PRINT.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">90%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the total German stock market turnover is earned in the financial center of Frankfurt. The euro currency sector is managed by the ECB in Frankfurt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankfurt has gained momentum after a string of banks — including Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Nomura and Standard Chartered — opted to beef up their operations in the German financial capital, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">FT </span></i><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f7397d3c-ce03-11e7-b781-794ce08b24dc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Various firms from the financial sector have created incubators, accelerators, labs, and similar playgrounds to promote FinTech business models. Notable examples of supportive spaces include </span><a href="https://www.techquartier.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechQuartier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.acceleratorfrankfurt.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accelerator Frankfurt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.main-incubator.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">main incubator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (+ </span><a href="http://www.between-the-towers.com/en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between the Towers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> initiative), </span><a href="http://www.thespot.tech/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Spot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, FinTech Hub by Deutsche Börse, </span><a href="https://lab.fintechgroup.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech Lab by FinTech Group AG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.vabn.de/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VABN by Aurelis Real Estate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not mentioning </span><a href="https://www.startupdigest.com/digests/frankfurtrheinmain"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regular events organized by entities supporting entrepreneurs, developers and other tech talent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The opening of TechQuartier marks the culmination of nearly a year’s work from the Hessen Ministry for Economics and the FinTech Dialogue Forum, which was initiated by Frankfurt Main Finance. Financial support for TechQuartier has come from a broad base of large banks and consulting firms. Platinum Sponsors include Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Börse, DZ Bank, Helaba and ING-DiBa.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the global scene, the </span><a href="https://startupservices.startupblink.com/ecosystem-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startup Ecosystem Ranking October 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> featuring 125 countries and 950 cities, places Germany on the fifth place following the US (first), UK (second), Canada (third), and Israel (fourth). Rankings are drawn from thousands of data points gathered since 2014, and provide an accumulative score across three verticals: the quality of startups, quantity of startups, and business environment. The report suggests that Germany as a country is enjoying a startup renaissance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from Berlin, which came fifth in the global city ranking, Germany has three additional cities in the top 100, starting with Munich, Hamburg, and Frankfurt (in ascending order).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Four cities in the top 100 is a great achievement, showing the diversity of the German startup ecosystem. On quantity and activity levels, Germany has closed the gap with the UK and Canada, and its next expected leap will happen when the ecosystem generates more unicorns and exits,” according to the report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Frankfurt cannot yet claim to be the hottest FinTech hub in Europe, it certainly is on the way to a much more prominent role in bringing out the best of technological advancements into the business world. Large corporations are some of the most active supporters of the local tech talent. A year ago, Deutsche Bank opened its own innovation discovery and adoption engine – </span><a href="https://www.db.com/newsroom_news/2016/medien/deutsche-bank-opens-digital-factory-in-frankfurt-en-11701.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Digital Factory in Frankfurt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – with the goal for the Digital Factory to be a driver in innovation, digitalization, and re-engineering of the bank. “The Deutsche Bank Labs discover and evaluate new ideas. At the Digital Factory, we translate these ideas into real products and services for our clients,” said </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kim-hammonds-29848a4/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim Hammonds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Member of the Management Board of Deutsche Bank and Group Chief Operating Officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October 2014, Commerzbank, an international commercial bank with branches and offices in more than 50 countries, found </span><a href="http://www.commerzventures.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommerzVentures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Frankfurt) as a corporate VC entity with focus on FinTech. CommerzVentures backs early- and growth-stage companies in the financial services and insurance sectors, starting at Series A. For its portfolio companies, the fund offers access to key decision makers within Commerzbank Group and other relevant players in banking and insurance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another leading institution, Deutsche Börse, launched its own instrument to nurture innovation in FinServ. </span><a href="http://www.venture-network.com/dbvn-en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deutsche Börse Venture Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched with 69 partners (27 companies and 42 investors) in April 2015. Having invested $718.46 million within a year from the launch, Deutsche Börse opened The FinTech in Frankfurt in April 2016 to promote early-stage FinTech companies. In September 2016, the institution launched The Venture Match service that enables targeted matching of investors and businesses in current funding rounds for the first time. By January 2017, member companies reached over $1 billion in financing volume. Today, the number surpasses $1.55 billion.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

                <title>Daily Review: Online + Offline = The Future of Retail</title>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to the widespread belief that physical retail is widely believed to be playing a diminishing role in modern lifestyle, the future of commerce will be at the intersection of online and offline worlds. Amazon + Whole Foods, and now Alibaba + Sun Art are defining the winning strategy in global commerce.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese online shopping giant Alibaba pins its hopes on physical stores as it buys hypermarket chain for £2.2 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Alibaba will buy a 36% stake in Sun Art as it tries to cash in on China's $500 billion food retail sector.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Since 2015, Alibaba has invested around £7 billion in physical stores.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The move follows Amazon's £10.3billion purchase of Whole Foods earlier this year, allowing the organic grocery chain to cut prices on its best-selling staple products and begin a delivery service for customers.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-5101443/Chinese-giant-Alibaba-buys-hypermarket-chain-2-2bn.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<hr />

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">No longer brick-and-mortar vs. online retail: Customers view a ‘single lens’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Despite the ease of online shopping, consumers still crave the tactile experience of physical stores.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Rather than pitting the two channels against each other, retailers can secure a much larger wallet share by giving consumers the best of both worlds through the adoption and use of new technologies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">By offering complimentary benefits, as well as engaging customers via mobile, both in-store and online retailer channels can strengthen overall customer engagement and brand affinity. And the best news for retailers taking an integrated approach: higher revenues and profitability.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Examples: Amazon + Whole Foods, Walmart + Bonobos, Walmart + ModCloth. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The “look before you buy” experience requires a certain level of physical presence. Examples: Casper + Target partnership, Amazon’s Prime Wardrobe, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Online comes together with offline through various beneficial strategies: added offline incentives based on online purchases, payment perks, a more personal customer experience offline integrated with rapid inventory availability online. Examples of blended omnichannel strategy: Best Buy, Home Depot, etc.</span></li>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The year 2017 was the most pivotal year for wealth management – technology startups shot themselves in the foot, empowering the next wave of transformation in one of the most asset-heavy segments. Taking their time to watch, interact, and learn, financial institutions have evolved beyond recognition in their strategies. A number of entities have demonstrated the ability to compete with bold technology startups both in terms of adoption of advanced technologies, and costs to the business and consumer. </span><a href="http://newsroom.bbvacompass.com/2016-01-12-BBVA-Compass-teams-with-FutureAdvisor-to-offer-clients-access-to-comprehensive-affordable-investment-advice-anytime-anywhere"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BBVA (&amp; FutureAdvisor)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161115006304/en/Wells-Fargo-Advisors-SigFig-Collaborate-Digital-Advisory"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wells Fargo (&amp; SigFig)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.ftadviser.com/your-industry/2017/06/14/barclays-claims-new-service-beats-robo-advice/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Barclays</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fidelity-launches-automated-investment-advice-service-1469592060"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fidelity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://time.com/money/4371434/capital-one-launches-digital-advice/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital One</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutschebank-funds-idUSKBN0TQ1Z220151207"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deutsche Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/13/reuters-america-morgan-stanley-is-developing-robo-adviser-like-automated-investing-platform-for-wealth-clients-hassan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-bancorp-futureadvisor-team-up-in-another-advance-for-bank-robo-advisers-1472168318"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Bancorp (&amp; FutureAdvisor)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.tdameritrade.com/home.page"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TD Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2017/06/06/tiaa-launches-robo-advisor-with-socially-responsib?slreturn=1501816285"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TIAA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/build-business-not-channel-launching-robo-advisor-inside-large-bank/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UBS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2017/02/08/merrill-edge-launches-robo-advisor-with-a-twist"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merrill Lynch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.investmentexecutive.com/-/atb-launches-new-robo-advisor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ATB</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/26/reuters-america-chinese-banks-brokers-eye-robo-advice-for-edge-on-competition.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">China Merchants Bank (CMB)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/21/goldman-building-robo-adviser-to-give-investment-advice-to-the-masses.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman Sachs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.rbcwealthmanagement.com/us/en/news/2016-02-02/rbc-wealth-management-collaborates-with-futureadvisor-to-launch-digital-advice-pilot-in-the-us/detail/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RBC &amp; FutureAdvisor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.tearsheet.co/modern-banking-experience/bnp-paribas-is-putting-human-advice-before-robots"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BNP Paribas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.sc.com/en/news-and-media/news/global/2017-04-05-SCB-Private-Bank-launches-first-digital-wealth-advisory-tool.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standard Chartered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://about.etrade.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=974739"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E*TRADE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.finews.asia/finance/25987-china-everbright-ginmon-partnership-shanghai-etfs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">China Everbright Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2017/11/20/robo-advisory-moves-should-boost-rbss-profits/#4afd1d14344f"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RBS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2119722/icbc-launches-robo-adviser-service-wealth-management-products"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are just some of the most recent examples of institutional response to the rise of WealthTech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While certainly opportunistic, wealth management is a segment with high barriers to entry, in addition to being </span><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-us-still-has-the-robo-advisor-lead-2017-4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly disproportionate in terms of AUM distribution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Vanguard Personal Advisor Services had </span><a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/vpabroc.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$93 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AUM as of September 2017 – a</span><a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/rating-the-robo-advisors-1501303316"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 12%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growth from October 2016. For comparison, Betterment had ‘only’ </span><a href="https://www.betterment.com/press/newsroom/robo-advisor-betterment-personalization-push-surpasses-10-billion-aum/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$10 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AUM as of July 2017, Wealthfront had $7 billion AUM as of August 2017, and Personal Capital had </span><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/5-billion-aum/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$5 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AUM as of August 2017 (gained $2 billion AUM in 2016 alone).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The above-mentioned hallmarks served an advantage for institutional players to build proprietary solutions to challenge the hype surrounding startups (with the sheer economics always remaining on the institutional side). Lower account minimums, lower fees, rock-bottom commissions, target audience expansion, automated rebalancing, and, in general, a bet on advanced technology + an expert in wealth management, are </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/how-financial-institutions-stepping-up-their-game-in-wealth-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the new normal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While non-institutional players will likely fall victim to overcrowding and consolidation of resources through partnerships and acquisitions, startups changed the face of wealth management in the long term. Robo-advisors powered by technology will diminish the barriers to market entry to a range of whole new types of players. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both financial and non-financial services firms can take advantage, bringing new levels of competition and innovation to the industry. For instance, we will likely see more asset management and insurance firms adding wealth advice to their distribution and effectively entering wealth management; non-financial service firms with access to large numbers of retail investors and leading-edge technology firms will likely also enter wealth management through a robo-advice model,” experts from Deloitte </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/strategy/us-cons-disruptors-in-wealth-mgmt-final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emphasize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What did FinTech bring into wealth management exactly? The short answer is AI. </span><a href="https://blogs.thomsonreuters.com/financial-risk/wealth-management-private-banking/how-ai-is-supercharging-wealth-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thompson Reuters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggests that cognitive software platforms, which provide the tools to analyze, organize, access, and provide advisory services based on a range of structured and unstructured data, are set to attract investment of nearly $2.5 billion in this year alone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outlining the ways that AI is supercharging the wealth management industry, </span><a href="https://blogs.thomsonreuters.com/financial-risk/wealth-management-private-banking/how-ai-is-supercharging-wealth-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thompson Reuters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> emphasizes the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Expanding advisory capabilities beyond human capacity following the data explosion (more data will be created in 2017 than in the last 5,000 years. And it’s expected to increase three times from this year until 2021);</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"With AI you can scan the available market data and understand events and triggers that change the market situation and potential performance of certain sectors, certain stocks. It's all about the ability to process a huge amount of data, define the rules and drive the right rules," </span><a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/beyond-robo-advisers-how-ai-could-rewire-wealth-management"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Oliver Bussmann.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Augmented intelligence platforms;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Goals-based wealth management;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Expert virtual advisor deployed as an API plug-in.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Intelligent applications based on cognitive computing, artificial intelligence, and deep learning are the next wave of technology transforming how consumers and enterprises work, learn, and play," </span><a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS42439617"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=PRF003956"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> David Schubmehl</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Research Director, Cognitive Systems and Content Analytics at IDC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These applications are being developed and implemented on cognitive/AI software platforms that offer the tools and capabilities to provide predictions, recommendations, and intelligent assistance through the use of cognitive systems, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Cognitive/AI systems are quickly becoming a key part of IT infrastructure and all enterprises need to understand and plan for the adoption and use of these technologies in their organizations," Schubmehl suggests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The International Data Corporation (</span><a href="http://www.idc.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span><a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS42439617"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forecasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that worldwide revenues for cognitive and AI systems will reach $12.5 billion in 2017, an increase of 59.3% over 2016. Global spending on cognitive and AI solutions will continue to see significant corporate investment over the next several years, achieving a CAGR of 54.4% through 2020 when revenues will be more than $46 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment industry is now shaped by the trend called </span><a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/investment-managers-must-embrace-technological-130000798.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Watsonization</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;">’ which refers to cognitive computing systems that can interpret massive quantities of data, learn as they go, and will hold an information advantage over today’s analysts. They will also give investment firms powerful new tools for interacting with investors, assessing risk, enhancing cybersecurity and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost-efficient robo-advisors that will use sophisticated algorithms to made decisions about funds allocation will make a big wave in the industry and grow the total value of AUM of robo-advisors worldwide to </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/741512/aum-of-robo-advisors-globally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$8.1 trillion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020.</span></p>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin crosses new highs every other week despite sometimes unfavoring regulations coming into action. Last week was no exception – the value of daily transactions sent through Bitcoin network went from $200 million for the most part if January to $2.8 billion in a single day of November 16. Predictions suggest that </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-could-reach-10000-in-few-months-with-fund-managers-bullish-sentiment"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin will cross $10,000 in a few months</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – a new record for daily transactions is not far. </span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">For most of January, roughly $200 million worth of Bitcoin was being sent around the Bitcoin network per day. Near the end of May, days where more than $700 million was transacted on the network were common.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Roughly a billion dollars of value was sent around the Bitcoin network per day in early August. This number declined down to $600 million by late September before exploding to $1.5 billion by late October.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">November 16 set a new all-time high for value transacted over the Bitcoin network in a single day at $2,803,405,660.</span></li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guangzhou Metro passengers can now pay for their rides with the WeChat messaging app, as </span><a href="https://u.caixinglobal.com/search/%22Tencent%22.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tencent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> competes with its rival Alibaba to get on track in the public transportation sector.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Commuters in the southern metropolis have been able to take the subway after allowing the turnstile to scan a QR code generated by a WeChat in-app mini program. The turnstiles can scan the codes within 0.3 seconds. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The system also supports offline payments. Passengers without an internet connection can travel first and pay later when they are next online.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">As on the Guangzhou Metro, travelers on the Shanghai maglev line can use Alipay to pay for their tickets by scanning a QR code.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The public transportation sector has recently become the latest battleground for major mobile payment players like Tencent and Alibaba, who both hope to make an early entrance and secure a better position.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">WeChat faces competition from payment service provider UnionPay, which has also joined with Guangzhou Metro to provide mobile payment services for passengers.</span></li>

The regulator MAS, the VCs, the willingness of investors to back projects and the many mentors who freely share their invaluable experience and insights. Our win here will importantly open doors and bring new and exciting opportunities to our doorstep.</span></td>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitalism is a cultural construct as much as economic. In his talk, </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karybheemaiah/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kary Bheemaiah</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Head of Research at U Change, Associate Researcher &amp; Scientist at Cambridge Judge Business School, explains how capitalism has evolved over time and how we have blindly ended up outsourcing trust to the financial system at the expense of clarity. </span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. How can Google Cloud Platform (GCP) components be leveraged to meet MiFID II, GDPR, and PSD2 requirements?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. What RegTech solutions are worth looking at and how can banks evaluate them?</span></p>

                <title>Why Functionality Over Expansion Is The Right Move</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/fintech/insights/remittance/2017/11/18/functionality-over-expansion-right-move/</link>
                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the remittance world, expansion isn’t everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there’s value in moving your business into new markets or regions, what's far more important is offering a compelling product to the markets that you currently serve. If you haven’t found the product-market fit, then expansion to new countries is at best meaningless, and at worst a huge distraction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before prioritizing geographic expansion, remittance companies ensure that they know how to serve their current market better than the competition. Whether it is additional cash-in locations or home delivery, bots or digital wallets, expanded money transfer offerings can attract new customers, retain current customers and provide a blueprint for expansion.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting cash fast</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's easy to forget that customers have markedly different preferences within a single market. While the convenience of bank transfers is obvious, nearly </span><a href="https://www.worldpaymentsreport.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the global population is unbanked. It's important to know your customer to understand how payments can fit into their lives, and not the other way around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try taking the time to ask current and prospective customers what payment options work best for them. Although direct deposit to a bank account may be convenient for some receivers, others may opt for funds to be loaded on their debit card. Some receivers have a deep distrust of the banking system, and the best methods to receive funds are cash locations near their home or even home delivery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every customer has their own financial situation and preferences. Consider rolling out a variety of options to appeal to more customers and ignite word-of-mouth.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catering to customers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost everywhere you look, </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/we-live-in-a-mobile-first-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consumers are going mobile</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Led by India, China, and Indonesia, new research suggests smartphone adoption across developing markets will increase from an average of</span><a href="https://www.gsmaintelligence.com/research/2017/02/smartphones-now-account-for-half-the-worlds-mobile-connections%20%20/600/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">47% in 2016</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to 62% by 2020. And if history is any indication, users will continue to become increasingly dependent on these devices. In </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/australia-one-of-the-fastest-growing-fintech-markets/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – where smartphone penetration has already topped</span><a href="http://landing.deloitte.com.au/rs/761-IBL-328/images/tmt-mobile-consumer-2016-final-report-101116.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">80%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – millions now rely on mobile phones for just about everything. In fact,</span><a href="http://www.roymorgan.com/findings/6857-smartphone-owners-who-cannot-live-without-them-australia-march-2016-201606200903"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly half of all owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> say they can’t live w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ithout their smartphones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand for the freedom and flexibility to transfer money anytime, anywhere continues to skyrocket; and mobile is the supply to that demand. Successful remittance companies will build their product offering around the continued mobile expansion in developing countries, leveraging mobile wallets, cash payment through mobile devices, and using mobile data as an underpinning for risk and compliance.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simplifying the sending process</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash is still king – even with the younger generation. About </span><a href="https://www.gobankingrates.com/net-worth/millennials-still-prefer-paid-cash/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">58% of consumers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aged 18-to-34-years-old prefer to use cash when paying their friends or family. Looking to appeal to these customers? Offer the option of paying for transfers with cold, hard cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it’s a local convenience store or nearby gas station, partnering with businesses in the area can help entice senders who want a quick and easy way to pay their loved ones at home and abroad. Rather than heading to a bank, customers will enjoy the luxury of paying for transfers at locations they routinely visit.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bringing convenience to the table</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many countries, reliable public transportation is a luxury – not an expectation. And without access to a private vehicle, traveling to receive payments can quickly become a troublesome affair. In a survey of 44 countries, Pew Research found that only </span><a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/16/car-bike-or-motorcycle-depends-on-where-you-live/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one-third of respondents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have a working car in their home. This lack of transportation often makes picking up payments both timely and expensive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With home delivery, however, those worries could soon fall by the wayside. Instead of venturing out to a specific pick up location, recipients can put their time to better use while also saving money. To top it off, there’s no need to worry about having precious funds stolen during or even after a transfer. This unique combination of speed, savings and security can go a long way toward enticing potential customers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quality over quantity</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much is made of geographic expansion as the benchmark for growth – and it can be. While that may be an effective strategy for some payments companies, others stand to grow their customer base and cement their place in the competitive landscape by focusing on functionality. From additional payout options to home delivery, new features that cater to the needs of customers can help usher in new business in a big way.</span></p>

                    <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 spotlight: ML/AI</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GS was among the pioneers to replace human traders with AI. At its height back in 2000, the US cash equities trading desk at Goldman Sachs’s New York headquarters employed 600 traders, buying and selling stock on the orders of the investment bank’s large clients. Today there are just two equity traders left. </span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603431/as-goldman-embraces-automation-even-the-masters-of-the-universe-are-threatened/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automated trading programs have taken over the rest of the work, supported by 200 computer engineers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The pattern will be repeated over and over, with 'Warren in a Box' being the most recent example.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">'Warren in a Box' to Pick Stocks for First Nordic AI Fund</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Finnish fund manager FIM is introducing the first investment fund in the Nordic region, where a self-learning algorithm gets to pick all the stocks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The FIM Artificial Intelligence fund seeks to tease out patterns even an experienced fund manager may not detect. “This is the next revolution across society, including in investing,” Chief Investment Officer Eelis Hein, who oversees $6.6 billion in investments at FIM Asset Management, said.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The “Warren in a box” technology, was in development for &gt;2 years. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The algorithm picks 50 stocks from a pre-screened universe of 4,000 liquid, developed-market equities, each with a market capitalization of 1 billion euros or more. After running the Warren algorithm, the AI applies a team-building algorithm, churning out a suitably diversified portfolio from the individual stock picks. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The database contains fundamental data on 700 variables going back to 1986. The fund’s allocation takes place every six months and the actual trading is done by a human.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Decentralized Artificial Intelligence Will Reinvent the Industry As We Know It</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">We are moving toward the next frontier – decentralized AI that can run and train on local devices or make decisions in decentralized networks like blockchain.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The transition to decentralized AI is enabled by new technologies, such as Google’s Federated Learning, that allow for crowd-training of ML algorithms, device-centric AI that runs and trains ML models on mobile devices and the use of AI in DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) on blockchain networks. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Powered by data flowing from thousands of users, and having access to resources and the ability to amass them, decentralized AIs can become a source of huge economic value for its owners.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Using generative models (GANs), we can create AI DAOs that trade in their own art, logos, sketches, images or video clips and distribute profits as cryptocurrency tokens to their shareholders.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">AI DAO can become the only shareholder of the accumulated capital. Example: Terra0. , a project involving an augmented self-owned forest proposed by Paul Seidler and Paul Kolling from the University of Arts, Berlin. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Centralized AI solutions provided as APIs and cloud-based services have certain bottlenecks. Since users access AI features via the network and because ML algorithms involve heavy computations, high latency is often an issue. Also, if you train AI models in a centralized way, it may take more time to improve them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Decentralized AI can function locally on users’ devices, have access to more user data and have no dependence on a network connection, which means less power consumption and minimal latency. Recent advances in decentralized AI have been made thanks to on-device optimization of AI/ML for smartphones and production of dedicated chips for mobile AI and for desktops (e.g., Google’s TPU).</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced details of the new $27million Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) Grant under the Financial Sector Technology and Innovation (FSTI) Scheme</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The new grant aims to promote the adoption and integration of AI and data analytics in financial institutions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The AIDA Grant will focus on two tracks: the Financial Institution Track and the Research Track. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Under the Financial Institution Track, the AIDA Grant will co-fund up to 50% of project costs for Singapore-based financial institutions which leverage AI and data analytics techniques to generate insights, formulate strategy, and assist in their decision making. These techniques may include ML, NLP or text analytics, deep learning or neural networks, predictive and prescriptive analytics.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Under the Research Track, the AIDA Grant will co-fund research institutions’ AI or data analytics projects which have clear applications for Singapore’s financial sector. The AIDA Grant will provide up to 70% co-funding for eligible projects.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The Grant will also provide funding for research projects submitted through periodic calls for proposals on specific AI or data analytics topics that benefit the industry. Such calls will be published on the MAS website.</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">On lending</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paytm and ICICI Bank tie-up to offer short-term instant digital credit</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Paytm has partnered with ICICI Bank to launch ‘Paytm-ICICI Bank Postpaid’ to offer access to interest-free short-term digital credit. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">This is the country’s first tie-up between a Scheduled Commercial Bank and a payments platform to offer instant digital credit for everyday use-cases.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Paytm-ICICI Bank Postpaid is a digital credit account with instant activation: with no hassles of documentation or branch visit. Activation is fully online. There is no transaction joining or hidden administration fees either.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Available 24x7, it is based on a new Big Data-based algorithm by ICICI Bank for the real-time credit assessment of customers. The algorithm uses an intelligent combination of the financial and digital behavior of the customer including credit bureau check, purchase patterns, frequency of purchase to ascertain the creditworthiness of a customer within a few seconds. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Based on the credit score of the customer, the bank offers up to 45 days interest-free credit limit. It ranges from Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 10,000, extendable up to Rs. 20,000 based on the repayment history. Paytm-ICICI Bank Postpaid will also offer a quick checkout to customers with the Paytm Passcode.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Customers can use their Paytm Wallet, debit card or internet banking of any bank for an easy repayment of their dues.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayPal to sell $6 billion in consumer loans to Synchrony Financial</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">PayPal agreed to sell $5.8 billion in consumer credit receivables to Synchrony Financial. These loans will generate $1 billion in revenue for 2017.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The deal also includes Synchrony’s acquisition of $1 billion in participation interests in PayPal receivables held by certain investors and a chartered financial institution.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">As a result of the deal, the two companies will expand their partnership by making Synchrony Bank the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit online consumer financing program available to PayPal customers in the US for the next 10 years.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">For PayPal, the deal means it will lose the interest the loans generate, but it will free up billions that it can use to grow its business in other ways.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Synchrony benefits by tapping into a source of consumer loans that’s more tied to online shopping – which is increasingly where consumers make large purchases requiring credit.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fujitsu Launches Inter-Blockchain Payment System</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fujitsu launched ConnectionChain payments technology aimed at facilitating transactions between blockchain in mid-November 2017. The payments system intends to provide a means for different cryptocurrency networks to interoperate with each other.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To effectively achieve a successful settlement between digital currencies, there should be a dependable application to manage the currency exchange processing at the boundaries between the blockchains in a transparent manner.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The payments technology can resolve the issues surrounding such transactions by inter-connecting multiple blockchains and execute a single transaction process that can be automatically executed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Fujitsu Laboratories has now developed an extension of smart contract technology which inter-connects multiple Blockchains by recording the series of related transactions on each chain in a dedicated Blockchain, or a "connection-type chain," to link to the currency exchange into a single transaction process that can be automatically executed. It has also developed a transaction control technology to synchronize execution timing of the transaction process on each chain."</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fujitsu plans to commercialize the technology starting 2018 (depending on the results of tests).</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">On InsurTech (reality check)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">About 95% of investment in InsurTech distribution models will be wasted, claims Guidewire Chief Executive Marcus Ryu. Recent investments in InsurTech amount to a bubble. $3.5bn has been invested in InsurTech over the past few years. It is not possible to spend that money productively, Ryu warned.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Areas of InsurTech spending that are relevant and useful: satellite and commercial sensor data aggregation and photo-based estimating. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Attempts to change insurance distribution models will not be a disruptive force and worth the amount of money that has been funneled into it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">InsurTech companies are using the metric of customer acquisition to show progress. It is a good way to measure progress for consumer internet firms but does not lead to a tangible benefit for an insurer. “If you’re an insurance company it’s very easy to get customer acquisition. Any insurance company can acquire all the customers they want and lose money on every one of them. The fact that they were thinking in terms of consumer internet attitude [is telling], you have to spend a lot, take lot of losses, but acquire a lot of customers and then figure out how to make money on them later. It does not work.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Interesting things were being seen in smaller volume markets. Success there is likely caused by the ability to tackle a small segment of the overall market with niche products.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">P2P insurance risk-sharing models are tiny and not consequential yet. They should be viewed as experiments and they are all currently “significantly loss-making.”</span></li>

                <title>Collection Headaches – How a Dose of Payment Technology Can Boost Collections Revenue</title>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a minimum, payment technology should create a path of least resistance for the consumer, as difficulty in settling an outstanding bill means organizations risk missing out on prompt payments. The consumer must be able to move freely between the payment channels they choose – just because a consumer receives an outstanding bill through the mail doesn't mean they want to reply the same way. It may be more convenient to pay online or contact the agency by phone to pay the bill or negotiate a payment plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://start.mybillingtree.com/acton/media/15831/2017-arm-survey-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 Collection Agency Operations and Technology Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed businesses agree with this. Technology adoption and offering a variety of payment channels continued to be top priorities. Automated payments, interactive voice response (IVR) and virtual debt negotiation were three of the most popular payment methods, with many agencies realizing the benefits these technologies can bring – including 24/7 payments and streamlining manual, time-consuming processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is these three technologies that will really help collection agencies improve their bottom line, even as industry and consumer demands change in the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An automated payment plan is simple and user-friendly, keeping payments on-time and customers happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With automated payment plans through a web portal, a notification is sent electronically to the consumer. When accepted, the notification will automatically trigger a payment which is instantly taken out of the client’s account for each billing cycle. Automated systems like these are affordable, smart and can even integrate with current core systems, meaning agencies of all sizes can quickly reap the rewards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automated payments through portals have been helping the healthcare industry improve its revenue cycle management by letting patients receive electronic statements and pay their bills online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-gray-8815177/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh Gray</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vice President, athenaResearch, online access translates into financial rewards, "When clients increase portal adoption by 20% or more, they see improvements in patient pay yields of four to eight percent. They get paid more and faster. If you can get a patient on a portal, they're 13% more likely to return. The value of the patient who returns is eight to 20% higher." </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent healthcare report from athenaResearch cites the Summit Medical Group, a 500-physician group in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, as an example of one group that now receives 30% of its patient payments via online portals.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interactive Voice Response – prompt payments, more time for accounts staff</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology uses automated call scripts which allow the consumer to pay via touch-tone prompts, helping improve the consumer experience. Providing consumers with a simple automated method to pay a bill, whenever and however they want to, can significantly improve the chances of receiving a payment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But IVR technology isn't just a great way to improve payment collections and enhance customer service – the technology also frees up time for accounts receivable staff to deal with more critical work that needs their attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pmgray/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phil Gray</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, executive vice president of Interactions, developers of enterprise intelligent assistants, IVR system has helped his company cut down on missed calls by 60% and that the technology has directly led to a 15% increase in revenue per call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are still challenges for companies looking to adopt IVR systems. An IVR system not designed with the customer in mind has the potential to decrease the likelihood of payment through this method. A quick resolution is what customers are looking for when they are using IVR, and if your automated system fails to meet this expectation, then the chances are the customer will permanently ditch your services and find another way to pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ease of use is another challenge. Customers prefer using systems that require the least effort and time. More complex and time-consuming IVR will turn them off, so having an easy to understand the system with as few steps as possible will help collections rather than hinder them.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual Negotiation – discuss your payment plan in private</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a consumer can’t settle their bill in full, then it might be time to negotiate. Virtual negotiation technology is enabling consumers to handle this privately, online, and without the discomfort or embarrassment of face-to-face interaction – and again saving employee time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A three-step process enables the consumer and the accounts receivable department to agree to a payment plan that works for both. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">1. The consumer is first notified of a minimum payment amount and maximum payment length. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">2. They can then either accept or make a counteroffer of how much they would like to pay back and for how long. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">3. The virtual negotiation system will then accept or reject the offer. If rejected, the consumer will receive a further counter offer which they can either accept or reject or re-negotiate the amount or length of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer demands and an ever-changing business environment make it crucial for collectors to offer an expanded virtual negotiation technology solution for easy access to payment information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But many technology vendors in today’s collection industry offer systems that are made up of individual products stuck together rather than integrated. The results are inefficient systems that are being forced together, often losing some of the critical functionality of each separate solution. The training process can also be difficult, as managers need to learn how to operate all of the new products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, collection organizations considering a new technology purchase – or an upgrade of their existing system – should look for a vendor that offers a complete, integrated solution. The solution needs to have the flexibility to meet their changing needs, to grow as they grow and not box them into a limited system – a single, unified platform that eases collection pains.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology crucial to better collections</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The integration of different payment collection technologies is a top priority for agencies, and technology solution providers will play a critical role in helping the ARM industry remain competitive and profitable in the future.</span></p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">On trends – banks are still the masters of the financial services industry </span></h1>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman Sachs’ Marcus is winning the personal loans arms race</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Marcus is pushing an us-versus-them anti-fee campaign highlighting potentially predatory practices of online lenders like Lending Club.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">As of late Monday, Marcus by Goldman Sachs lent $2 billion to customers. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Meanwhile, Lending Club has reported losses exceeding $200 million over the last six quarters; Prosper has lost $210 million since the start of 2016, despite various cost-cutting measures, and lost its unicorn status. Even OnDeck Capital, which focuses on small businesses, is struggling to become profitable, having reported losses over eight consecutive quarters. On top of it, the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank laid into such companies in a report Thursday, calling online lending a “predatory” business requiring more regulation. Marcus passed $1 billion in loans this summer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Marcus, which offers personal loans to consumers between $3,500 and $30,000, has obvious advantages over its Silicon Valley competitors: a household name brand like Goldman Sachs behind it, the ability to raise FDIC-insured deposits as a deposit-taking institution and deep relationships with institutional investors that purchase consumer loans — like Goldman Sachs, which helps fund Prosper loans and is effectively competing with its own customer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Goldman sees a $13 billion lending opportunity with Marcus over three years, CFO Marty Chavez said Tuesday in remarks at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Future of Financials Conference.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Since late October, Marcus has been pushing an anti-fee campaign scripted to show how frequently and commonly people accept fees without fully understanding why the fee structure is in place in the first place and perhaps even highlight the fee structures at competing companies; namely, Lending Club, one of the largest players in online lending with more fees in place than its peers.</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech sector needs a meaningful investment fund says challenger bank boss</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexletts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Letts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the founder of a challenger bank U (~50,000 customers), said that the sector is some way off from having the firepower to sufficiently challenge the mainstream banking sector and called for the establishment of a meaningful investment fund to support FinTech startups. </span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Mr. Letts questions whether the challenger banks were radically different from mainstream banking, positing that some had simply “put new clothes on the emperor”. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“The other side are what I call the ‘neobanks,’ people coming in with much hurrah and hysteria and telling everyone that the big banks are finished and that they are going to take over the world. I can absolutely tell you they are not. But what I can say is that incremental change for them is very easy and simple. They have beautiful digital footprints, the support of regulators and in many cases some very bright people running them and a modern attitude."</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“I do believe in their skills and that they can offer a brighter fresher future for banking but I don’t believe they have done anything truly disruptive. I do not believe that they have done anything more than put new clothes on the emperor.”</span></li>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">On fraud</span></h1>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2/3 of Businesses Experienced Increased Fraud Attempts in 2017, a 58% Increase over Previous Year – IDology Annual Fraud Report</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Shifting tactics used by criminals, along with the complexity of identity verification are the top challenges to fraud prevention.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Addressing rising synthetic identity fraud and improving the customer experience by reducing friction are key areas of strategic interest.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">More than half of companies reported an increase in mobile-based fraud, led by device cloning.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">About 67% of organizations reported an increase in fraud attempts, compared to just 42 percent in 2016, an increase of 58 percent. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Criminals are using more sophisticated schemes that are harder to detect, such as synthetic identity fraud (SIF), a combination of real and fabricated identity information used to create a new identity. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">"The data indicates that fraud is growing in prevalence, type, and sophistication and this is changing how businesses approach the identity verification value chain," said John Dancu, CEO of IDology. "In today's post-breach environment, pulling together and assessing identities based on several smart layers of information from different sources, including data on mobile devices, ensures legitimate customers are approved with less friction for a more secure and positive experience."</span></li>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">On payments</span></h1>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital payments expected to hit 726 billion by 2020 — but cash isn't going anywhere yet</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">People around the world are expected to make 726 billion transactions using digital payment technologies by 2020. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Emerging markets are leading the upward trend, and tech innovations such as connected homes, contactless bank cards, wearable devices and augmented reality will drive cashless transactions in the future.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">"Curiously, though the number of transactions continues to rise at a rapid rate, the average USD value per transaction has decreased slightly, as digital establishes itself as a growing rival to cash for low-cost purchases."</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Between 2014 and 2015, debit cards accounted for the highest share of non-cash payments at 46.7%, while credit cards trailed behind at 19.5%. Non-cash transactions rose 11.2%, the highest growth of the past decade.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Contactless cards are seen as "the new normal," especially in Europe. In France, the circulation of Visa contactless cards doubled to 40 million in 2015 from 20.3 million the previous year. The U.K. was the biggest market for contactless payments in Europe, with cards in circulation reaching 106.9 million in 2015.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">But cash still remains the mainstream means of payment, especially for low-value transactions. "Cash continues to play a key role for many, and a crucial role for some," Bank of England Chief Cashier Victoria Cleland said.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Americans still look to cash as their preferred method of payment — although physical cash came in second place, behind debit cards.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Emerging markets are expected to grow at a rate three times that of developed economies in terms of digital transaction volumes. Non-cash payments in Asian emerging markets are projected to grow by almost a third (30.9%), led by powerhouses China and India. Digital invoicing, virtual payment cards and cloud-based accounting are also seeing popular use in emerging Asian economies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">FinTech firms and incoming regulation are transforming the payments landscape. "Within this new and dynamic ecosystem, payments industry participants must strategically reassess their roles," Anirban Bose, head of global banking and capital markets at Capgemini. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">In an open banking ecosystem, banks are expected to open up their application programming interfaces (APIs) to third-party payment providers. APIs are codes that allow different financial programs to communicate with each other. Open APIs allow developers to gain access to the software applications of banks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">"Banks must embrace this opportunity to enhance their offerings in collaboration with FinTechs and third-party developers. Breakthrough technologies and significant industry advances, such as open APIs, instant payments, blockchain and regulatory standardization, will encourage collaboration," Bose said. </span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">India's Supreme Court Calls on Government to Regulate Bitcoin</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three justices issued a notice to the central bank, the market regulator, the tax department, and several other agencies, </span><a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-seeks-govts-response-on-plea-to-regulate-bitcoin/article20445197.ece"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asking them to answer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a petition on the matter.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">According to the petition: "The lack of any concrete [control] mechanism pending the regulatory framework in said regard has left a lot of vacuum and which has resulted in total unaccountability and unregulated Bitcoin (crypto money) trading and transactions."</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The petition goes on to state that bitcoin exchanges in India add 2,500 users per day, and that some 500,000 residents now hold bitcoin. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">As a result of its adoption, bitcoin usage may affect "the market value of other commodities," according to the petition, which pleaded with the court for an "urgent direction" for the government to intervene.</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">UK Financial Authority Warns Investors Against Cryptocurrency Derivatives</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">FCA has issued a warning to investors against venturing into cryptocurrency contracts for differences (CFDs). The agency claimed that digital currency-based CFDs are considered to be high-risk investments.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FCA </span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/consumer-warning-about-risks-investing-cryptocurrency-cfds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">issued its warning to investors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against investing in crypto-based CFDs due to several risks that they could face, among which are price volatility, leverage, charges and funding costs and price transparency. The legal safeguards currently in place cannot protect investors and will not compensate them for any losses that they could incur from trading.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">In June 2017, FCA Director of Strategy and Competition, Chris Woolard, warned that investors should exercise a degree of caution when dealing with cryptocurrencies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, the </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-issues-warning-against-onecoin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has also cautioned that </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-issues-warning-against-onecoin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICOs are “very risky”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investments and asked would-be participants to inform or report to the agency any possible fraud that they may encounter in the cryptocurrency-based funding model.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Other countries such as Germany, United States, and the Netherlands have also released their warnings about investing in ICOs earlier this month.</span></li>

                    <p><b>Mumbai, November 15, 2017</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — Nomura, Asia’s global investment bank, today hosted a demo day for startups chosen as part of the ‘Voyager - Nomura FinTech Partnership’ program in India.

                <title>Daily Review: Square Tests Bitcoin Trading, ICBC Launches a Robo-Advisor &amp; Alibaba Sets Another Record</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/bitcoin/fintech/insights/robo-advisors/2017/11/16/square-tests-bitcoin-trading-icbc-launches-robo-advisors-alibaba-sets-another-record/</link>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Bitcoin hits new highs, big FinTech firms flock to the cryptocurrency to meet consumer demand. Whether this is an attempt to ride the wave, or out of sincere belief in the future of cryptocurrency, Square's beta of cryptocurrency trading is certainly a positive sign for the affectionate community. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Square Cash is letting some users buy and sell Bitcoin</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Square is </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/11/14/square-cash-a-new-place-to-buy-and-sell-bitcoin/#70a568277194%C2%A0%E2%80%A6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">testing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cryptocurrency support in their Cash app. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trial, available right now to a small number of users, lets users buy and sell Bitcoin directly in the app. Users who have access to the beta can swipe right from the Cash Card page to access Bitcoin functionality.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Square is likely using pooled wallets to hold user funds and not storing private keys on a user’s device, similar to how Coinbase works.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the feature is centered around buying and selling Bitcoin and not sending and receiving. There’s a (potentially non-functioning) option to generate an address to receive Bitcoin, but no option to send it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re always listening to our customers and we’ve found that they are interested in using the Cash app to buy Bitcoin. We’re exploring how Square can make this experience faster and easier, and have rolled out this feature to a small number of Cash app customers. We believe cryptocurrency can greatly impact the ability of individuals to participate in the global financial system and we’re excited to learn more here.” – Square Spokesperson.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICBC, the nation’s largest bank by assets becomes the first of China’s ‘big four’ lenders to offer automated advice and product service. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICBC launches robo-adviser service for wealth-management products</span></h2>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICBC has applied the latest AI-led technology to its wealth-management operations. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its newly launched robo-adviser service will see computer programs dish out investment advice to retail investors over its mobile banking platform, becoming the first among the nation’s “big four” state-owned lenders to unlock the potential of the hot new service being adopted rapidly by the industry, worldwide.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The value of China’s total robo-adviser services (banks + asset managers + FinTech) is expected to top US $783 billion by 2020. Globally, the segment is projected to reach US $6.5 trillion by 2025, up from US $100 billion in 2016. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICBC is the nation’s largest bank by assets, but small- and mid-sized mainland banks have already tested such services. </span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alibaba smashes its Single’s Day record once again as sales cross $25 billion</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alibaba has set another Single’s Day record after the e-commerce giant sold over $25 billion in GMV on the Chinese biggest online shopping date.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alibaba handled 1.48 billion transactions during the 24-hour period – a 39% increase in last year’s sales total of RMB $17.79 billion.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s 11/11 got off to a fast start with around $7 billion of goods sold in the first 30 minutes of the day alone. Alibaba went on to surpass last year’s $18 billion total after just 12 hours of sales.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 90% of sales were made on mobile which is up on 82% for 2016 and 69% in 2015.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total order numbers hit 812 million, up 23%.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 140,000 brands – including 60,000 international – took part in Tmall where they offered 15 million product listings.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">167 merchants generated over $15.1 million in sales each.</span></li>

                <title>Marketplace Expansion: The Secrets to Success</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/commerce/insights/retail/2017/11/16/marketplace-expansion-the-secrets-to-success/</link>
                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global expansion isn’t always easy – just ask Target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help kick off its expansion efforts into Canada, the retail giant took over the leases to</span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703583404576079690417970136"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">220 Zellers locations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2011. About four years later, Target made a hasty retreat from the Great White North, shuttering its Canadian business almost overnight. Of course, this kind of expansion blunder (which cost the company </span><a href="http://fortune.com/2015/04/02/target-canada-store-closing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">roughly $7 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) isn’t unique to Target. Other well-known companies – such as eBay and Best Buy – have faced their own struggles during forays abroad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a marketplace looking to expand, how can you avoid a similar fate? Reduce the risk with data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Far too often, businesses rely on ill-informed strategies that don’t provide the greatest shot at global success. The </span><a href="http://expansion.hyperwallet.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 Marketplace Expansion Index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help fill that knowledge gap. Instead of basing international growth decisions solely on a country’s proximity or payment infrastructure, the Index leverages 10 key factors – including ease of doing business, the level of English proficiency, and retail e-commerce market size – to gauge the expansion-readiness of 36 different countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of the countries is divided into three tiers based on their attractiveness: established, emerging and evolving. But just because a country is in the “established” category doesn’t mean it’s a good fit for your business. Here’s a look at five emerging countries that may better align with your company’s unique strengths and weaknesses.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Belgium</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancing is far from a foreign concept in Belgium. In fact, about 30% of Belgians already do some sort of freelancing work in their spare time. The emergence of robust payment and logistics infrastructure will likely make it even easier for </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/how-fintech-serves-gig-economy-and-workforce/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gig economy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies to scale locally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For service-based platforms, however, things may get little tricky. Steep social security taxes coupled with the second-highest corporate tax rate in Europe may quickly stunt business growth. Minimize human support to free up resources where necessary.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Sweden</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweden isn’t known for its size. With a population size of about</span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-05/watch-out-sweden-hits-10-million-people"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">10 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people, Sweden ranks well behind other expansion destinations. But when it comes to payments, the Scandinavian nation more than makes up for its small-but-growing population. Given the country’s exceptional payments and logistics infrastructure, nearly 99% of the workforce receives their paychecks directly into a bank account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swedes have also fully embraced the sharing economy. Around a third of the population has participated in the sharing economy at one point or another. From furniture to kitchen appliances, there’s almost no limit to what Swedes are willing to rent.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Hong Kong</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For goods-based marketplaces, </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/hong-kong-home-european-fintech-startups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hong Kong is the place to be</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. More than 85% of transactions involve cross-border movement – the highest in any country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acceptance of the sharing economy, however, is a different story. Despite the fact that 82% of Hong Kong citizens have been consumers of sharing economy activities, heavy regulations continue to stunt the industry’s growth. In May 2017, more than</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-tech-hongkong-arrests/hong-kong-police-arrest-21-uber-drivers-idUSKBN18J0GG"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">20 Uber drivers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were arrested on the suspicion of illegally carrying passengers for hire and not having third-party insurance. Businesses aiming to enter Hong Kong’s sharing economy need to keep a close eye on changes within this protectionist regulatory environment.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Israel</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although political unrest has plagued Israel at times, the country remains a hotbed for sharing economy startups. From Gett to Juno, a number of Israeli-developed ride-sharing platforms have launched successful pilot projects. Since Israel’s customer base is especially receptive to new services and goods marketplaces, there’s plenty of opportunity for innovation. Only speak English? No problem. Israel boasts a large English-speaking population that spends more time online per capita than people living anywhere else. Businesses that cater to this increasingly digital consumer base can quickly move one step ahead of the competition.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Malaysia</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like Israel, Malaysia has suffered the brunt of political turmoil in recent years. A scandal surrounding the</span><a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/365551"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1Malaysia Development Berhad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (1MDB) fund has caused the ringgit – Malaysia’s most prominent currency – to regularly fluctuate in value. Still, though, emerging digital platforms would be wise to consider expansion into Malaysia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a growing unemployment rate, Malaysian workers are more eager to pick up digital work than ever before. And by 2020, digital economy activities could contribute toward nearly one-fifth of Malaysia’s domestic productivity. Don’t miss your chance to take advantage of this burgeoning digital economy.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make no mistake – marketplace expansion is a significant undertaking. But if done right, it can help your company reach new heights. From surveying local competition to gauging e-commerce activity, give your business the best chance at expansion success by keeping strategic marketplace factors in mind.</span></p>

                <title>How One FinTech Startup Reduces Default &amp; Interest Rates Through Electronic Consigned Credit Management</title>

                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"There is no market in which we find that interest has not been reduced by our platform," said </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C3%A1lvaro-amorim-445651109/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Álvaro Amorim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CEO of FinTech firm </span><a href="http://www.salaryfits.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SalaryFits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Spain, and responsible for the company's implementation in India.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.salaryfits.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SalaryFits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a spinoff of </span><a href="https://www.zetrasoft.com.br/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zetra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Brazilian FinTech with 18 years in the Brazilian market and leader in the electronic management of the loans with payroll deduction (consigned credit). It has a management system launched in 2002, called </span><a href="https://www.zetrasoft.com.br/en/products/econsig-payroll-deduction-loan-manager-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eConsig</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that integrates the systems of banks for loans with the human resources of companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 14 years, Zetra expanded to other countries, and nowadays, it has a presence in six markets besides Brazil through SalaryFits: Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, Portugal, India, and Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the company is incorporating other services in the application, such as health insurance and other products and services.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28432" src="/uploads/2017/11/salaryfits-logo3-amarela.png" alt="How One FinTech Startup Reduces Default &amp; Interest Rates Through Electronic Consigned Credit Management" width="461" height="146" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduction of default and interest</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, the default rate in Mexico for personal loans was between 3.1% and 5%. With the Zetra platform, according to company data, the default rate is currently around 1.60% for the company eNomina. Out of the countries where Zetra operates, Mexico is the only market that already had a payroll loan format similar to Brazil's.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to reducing default rates, the company manages to reduce interest rates in new markets. "We launched the SalaryFits platform in Portugal, and the partner bank provided consumer credit at an average of 9 to 11% interest per year. Through the platform and through the use of the application, we have been able to reduce the interest offered by half," said Amorim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, Amorim talks about the implementation of the operation in other countries.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28434" src="/uploads/2017/11/zetra.png" alt="How One FinTech Startup Reduces Default &amp; Interest Rates Through Electronic Consigned Credit Management" width="333" height="151" /></p>
<p><b>Are there many differences between the operation of a FinTech in Brazil and in other countries?</b></p>
<p><b>Álvaro Amorim:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> People are starting to ride this FinTech wave now in Brazil. In other countries, it is already more than reality. In Brazil, there is an excess of bureaucracy but the Central Bank is open for discussions and even consulted the public on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zetra is fully compliant with the Central Bank’s requirements for lending businesses. </span></p>
<p><b>What challenges does your company need to overcome when expanding into new markets? </b></p>
<p><b>AA: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, we bring the concept of the new product in order to strategically establish the platform with the link between the payroll and the credit provider.</span></p>
<p><b>What is Zetra's largest market outside Brazil?</b></p>
<p><b>AA:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Today, Zetra's second-largest market is in Mexico, and its India project is the most audacious. With regard to numbers, India will certainly be the largest scale that we will achieve. The platform aims to facilitate financial inclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per recent findings, only 23% of the population has access to banking and credit supply. The operation in India is already a year old. We will wait until the end of the year to run the pilot, and I believe that by the end of 2018, we will have an interesting scale there. [SalaryFits is one of the 20 startups of </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/india-fintech-awards-2017-meet-top-fintech-startups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">India FinTech Awards 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">].</span></p>
<p><b>How is it possible to reduce interest rates in new markets?</b></p>
<p><b>AA:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The reduction of interest rates becomes natural with the process established through the platform. When we provide digital channels where the financial institution has access to a larger number of new customers and also has data from the payroll that the bank previously would not have access to, we create a new access model risk. That is an upgrade on the credit score.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We still count on the presence of the employer. It guarantees that at the end of every month, the employer will make the payment on behalf of the employee, who receives the salary already with the discount. Even the effort for the bank to sell the loan is practically zero since the offer is all digital.</span></p>

                <title>Daily Review: PayPal Explores Crowdfunding, Launches Money Pools</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/crowdfunding/fintech/insights/payments/2017/11/14/paypal-explores-crowdfunding-launches-money-pools/</link>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its latest move, PayPal explores another line of business – crowdfunding – with a competitive edge for its current customers. While renowned platforms collect fees from campaigns, PayPal offers the service for free (for now and for its account holders only), locking its account holders inside the PayPal ecosystem while locking the competition out. PayPal is not the first large FinTech to get its hands into the two hottest segments – payments and lending (think </span><a href="https://squareup.com/townsquare/square-capital-now-offers-flexible-loans-to-boost-lending"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Square Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). After all, why bother with a cacophony of financial products when </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/global-fintech-funding-36-bn-2016/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two types of offers are steadily the most represented and most funded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayPal launches Money Pools, where groups chip in to raise money to buy things</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayPal launches </span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/money-pools"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money Pools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a service that lets people create pages to let their contacts fundraise for a specific item or event, such as buying a group gift, a group trip, or housemates paying the rent.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">PayPal is launching the service in 16 countries – Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States. Anyone who has a PayPal account in these regions can create a Money Pool, or contribute to one. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“Unlike crowdfunding solutions, Money Pools are not intended to facilitate fundraising for activities such as product development and organizers agree not to offer perks, rewards, or other incentives in return for contributions made to a Money Pool.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The service is free when you use money from your PayPal wallet, or a debit card or a bank account linked to your PayPal account. </span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/gb/selfhelp/article/faq690"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standard PayPal fees apply</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when you have to make a currency conversion or use a credit card (also linked to your PayPal account). For comparison, </span><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/paypal-launches-p2p-funding-platform-2017-11?IR=T"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GoFundMe and Kickstarter each take a 5% cut of the money raised on their sites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and GoFundMe also charges a 2.9% credit card processing fee plus 30 cents per donation.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Once you create a page, Money Pools works similarly to other social funding sites like GoFundMe: you can personalize the page with pictures and how you want contributions to appear (public or anonymously); you can update the site’s activity feed; and you can – important for social-payments – share a link to the campaign with a short URL.</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other read-worthy news:</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colossal SoftBank fund could shake up tech world</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Japan-based SoftBank's The Vision Fund's $100 billion nearly equals the total amount pumped into venture capital-backed companies in 2016.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The huge amount of cash could accelerate the trend where fast-growing startups remain private – without the scrutiny and transparency of a stock market debut.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">SoftBank has outlined plans to focus on late-stage investments when startups are more established, (and on investments of at least $100 million).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The SoftBank fund is widely expected to pump some $10 billion into ride-sharing giant Uber, which has a whopping valuation near $70 billion. Such a deal would boost the profile of the Japanese group in Silicon Valley.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">SoftBank's early, lucrative investment in Alibaba was part of a strategy focused on booming e-commerce in China, according to GGV Capital managing partner Hans Tung.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">SoftBank's recent investments in ride-sharing firms in various countries fit a pattern of seeking money-making synergies by bringing competitors together to share technology, learnings, and more. "Masayoshi Son understands the value of consolidation," said Tung. "It is affecting the way society moves from less efficient to more efficient, and the amount of innovation that could happen. If consolidation is somewhat expedited with SoftBank money, that is not necessarily a bad thing."</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Targets for the Vision Fund were expected to include e-commerce, ride-sharing, robotics, and machine learning.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">SoftBank has shown a preference for technology trends with the potential to spread across borders and have a significant impact on society, according to those who have tracked the company.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">And with all the data collected by ride-sharing, e-commerce and other platforms, investing in artificial intelligence to mine insights from mountains of information makes sense.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Insurance Sector Adopting Blockchain to Protect Data</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">A total of 14 European insurance providers have partnered together with Deloitte and other firms to provide a simple system for insurers to comply with the Hamon Law, with requires insurers to provide simple transfers for clients who wish to change companies during the first year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system will allow for highly secure information storage for customer data.

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The platform relies on Proof of Process technology in order to secure user data through a shared data repository. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The system will limit data release to the absolute minimum for processing transactions. </span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Open-Source Blockchain Projects Are Abandoned Within Six Months</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Just 8% of the 26,000 open-source blockchain projects created back in 2016 are still around today.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The average lifespan of an open-source blockchain project is just one year. In fact, most projects shut down within their first six months. By that time, the original excitement among developers and supporters has started to dwindle as it becomes harder to provide meaningful updates on a regular basis. </span></li>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><b>Ravi Menon’s Remarks at Singapore FinTech Festival</b><b><br />
</b><b>Singapore Expo – November 14, 2017</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to the second edition of the Singapore FinTech Festival:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> •  This is the largest gathering of the global FinTech community anywhere in the world.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  We have more than 25,000 participants from across 100 countries.</span></p>
<h6><b>“The Future Is Already Here”</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world is becoming more digital, especially here in Asia.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  According to Bain &amp; Company, in the past year alone, the number of online-engaged consumers in Southeast Asia has surged by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">50% </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to 200 million people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And FinTech – or the application of technology to financial services – has been at the forefront of this digital renaissance.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  According to Ernst &amp; Young, FinTech has already achieved initial mass adoption and is now poised for mainstream adoption.<br />
</span>•  About 1 in 3 digitally active users globally already consider themselves regular users of FinTech services. In China, that figure is nearly 70%.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singapore’s FinTech journey is set against this emerging digital future.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  It is also part of Singapore’s broader Smart Nation agenda, to harness the power of technology to support better living, increase productivity, and create new jobs.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  A smart nation needs a smart financial center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globally, the financial industry is facing slower economic growth, tighter regulation, and keener competition. It needs to foster innovation and transform itself.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  This means harnessing technology</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><b>- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">to increase efficiency, manage risks better, create new opportunities, and improve people’s lives</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  If Singapore is to maintain its position as one of the top financial centers in the world, it must embrace FinTech – maximizing its benefits, minimizing its risks.</span></p>
<h4><strong>STRATEGIES FOR A SMART FINANCIAL CENTRE</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, for the last two to three years, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has been working together with the industry to foster a thriving FinTech hub. This requires getting several pieces right:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  an ecosystem of diverse players competing and collaborating;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  an open architecture economy that enables connectivity and innovation;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  a web of international links to promote the exchange of ideas and scale solutions;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  a strong talent pool and deep research capabilities;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  a conducive regulatory environment; and<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  a safe and secure cyber environment.</span></p>
<h6><b>Ecosystem of Diverse Players</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to create an ecosystem for innovation, where established financial institutions and FinTech startups compete as well as collaborate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial institutions are no longer the laggards and technology dinosaurs of popular myth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know this from my conversations with CEOs of global banks and insurance companies.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Almost every major financial institution has an active innovation agenda to strengthen its business by harnessing technology.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Many CEOs today can carry on an intelligent conversation about blockchain without looking at their notes – this is a big change from just two years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singapore wants to be the place where these financial institutions test, develop, and apply new technology solutions.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> •  Just in the last few years, global MNCs have set up more than 30 FinTech innovation labs or research centers in Singapore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FinTech startup space has become a lot more vibrant.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  More than 400 FinTech enterprises have set up base in Singapore.<br />
</span>•  We have startups experimenting with new ways to pay, save, invest, buy insurance, and plan for retirement.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No innovation ecosystem is complete without physical spaces to facilitate experimentation and collaboration.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Last year, we saw the launch of LATTICE80, Singapore’s first FinTech innovation village, occupying two whole floors of 80 Robinson Road.<br />
</span><i>•   </i><b><i>Well, the entire building at 80 Robinson Road will now become a FinTech innovation hub.<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  It will be named 80RR – that’s 100,000 square feet dedicated to housing FinTechs, right in the heart of the financial district!</span></p>
<h6><b>Open Architecture</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A smart nation needs an “open API economy.” APIs are the “connectors” that allow systems to talk to one another, enabling service providers to harness information from multiple sources and produce holistic solutions for customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAS has been encouraging financial institutions to develop and share their APIs openly so that they can work with other service providers to give customers a richer and more seamless experience. We started the ball rolling last year.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  With the Finance-as-a-Service API Playbook, banks have a common guide to identify and develop APIs.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  And with the Financial Industry API Register, FinTech startups have a one-stop shop to explore the open APIs that have been made available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are pleased to see more banks in Singapore opening up their APIs, with tangible benefits to consumers.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  OCBC Bank has 43 open APIs on its platform that are actively been tapped on by FinTech players, and even government authorities such as the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  DBS Bank has launched the world’s largest banking API developer platform with more than 170 APIs and over 50 successful collaborations.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers looking for properties on the PropertyGuru platform can instantly find out if they are eligible for a property loan and even apply for the loan online.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  UOB has also recently put in place its regional open banking API platform.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> Customers can submit and read restaurant reviews, place reservations, and pay for their food, all within UOB’s mobile app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, over 270 open APIs have been made available by the Singapore financial industry.</span></p>
<h6><b>Network of International Links</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of this week, MAS will have signed 16 FinTech cooperation agreements with governments and authorities around the world.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  These agreements facilitate information sharing on FinTech trends and regulatory issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abu Dhabi, Australia, Denmark, France, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Poland, South Korea, Switzerland, Thailand and the United Kingdom, as well as the Association of Supervisors of Banks of the Americas.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  They also have a referral mechanism that supports Singapore FinTech startups in overseas markets, and facilitate overseas startups to set up in Singapore as a gateway to Asia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Some of our co-operation agreements also include joint innovation projects. Let me give a tangible example:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Singapore and Thailand have each developed their own systems for making payments from one bank account to another – in real-time, 24/7.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  We call our system PayNow; Thailand calls theirs PromptPay.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  </span><b>MAS and the Bank of Thailand have agreed to work together to link PayNow and PromptPay.<br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  The aim is to enable someone in Singapore to send money to someone in Thailand, and vice versa, using just their mobile phone numbers – instantly, securely, and at any time of the day.</span></p>
<h6><b>Talent and Research</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To sustain our FinTech efforts, we need a strong pipeline of talent and research capabilities.</span></p>
<p><b>We are pleased to announce that MAS and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have agreed to enter an R&amp;D collaboration in FinTech</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  This will enable our local FinTech talents to work alongside world-class researchers at the MIT Media Lab to come up with technology solutions to real-world use cases.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  They will run pilots using distributed ledger technology, cryptography, quantum computing and big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One area where we want to make a concerted effort is data analytics and artificial intelligence.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>•  MAS is launching a S$27 million Artificial Intelligence &amp; Data Analytics Grant. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is part of the S$225 million Financial Sector Technology &amp; Innovation Scheme.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  The new grant will support the adoption and integration of AI and data analytics in financial institutions.<br />
</span>•  Just as important, it will be used to help professionals in the financial sector to up-skill and adapt to the use of these new technologies.</p>
<h6><b>Conducive Regulation</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most critical pieces that we must get right is regulation.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  How can we make regulation conducive to FinTech innovation, while still ensuring that the system remains stable, key players are sound, and consumer interests are safeguarded?<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  This requires a keen understanding of emerging technologies and new business models, and being alert to potential risks while taking care not to stifle innovation.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Easier said than done! Let me give a few examples of how MAS has tried to strike the right balance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take for example virtual currencies, or commonly known as cryptocurrencies. MAS does not regulate virtual currencies; in fact, we welcome them as an innovation that can potentially reduce the cost of financial transactions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we regulate the activities that surround virtual currencies if these activities pose specific risks.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  First, virtual currency transactions could potentially be exploited for money laundering or terrorist financing due to the anonymous nature of the transactions.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> And so, intermediaries in virtual currency services will be subject to anti-money laundering requirements.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Second, virtual currencies can go beyond being a means of payment to representing ownership of assets, as we see in many Initial Coin Offerings or ICOs. This makes them look very much like a share or bond certificate.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> So, if the digital token is structured like a security, then the ICO must meet the requirements of the Securities and Futures Act. This is to protect investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech developments are forcing regulators to review the way regulation is done.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  If FinTech is unbundling the financial services value chain, then regulators may have to “unbundle” their regulations too.<br />
</span>•  I suspect, increasingly, we will have to take a <i>more risk-specific </i>approach and an <i>activity-based </i>approach with respect to FinTech. This means:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> Setting thresholds for when regulation kicks in;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> calibrating regulatory requirements to specific risks; and<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> applying these requirements to activities rather than entities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good example of our attempt to do this is the new Payment Services Bill, which we will publish for public consultation next week.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Our aim is to right-size the regulations, to fit the various new developments that are taking place in electronic payments.<br />
•  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Licensees will be regulated according to the activities they conduct because different activities pose different risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, there are areas – be it new technologies or new business models – where regulators will never know enough. This is where the regulatory sandbox comes in – to facilitate experimentation in a contained environment.</span></p>
<h6><b>Cybersecurity</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, cybersecurity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we go more digital and online, cyber-risks will mount. And if these risks are not managed well, public trust and confidence in technology will suffer.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  To fully harness the benefits of digital technology, we must build robust cyber-defenses and have effective remediation plans when things go wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, cyber-surveillance and information sharing. </span><b><i>We are pleased to see the official launch in Singapore of the Asia-Pacific Regional Information &amp; Analysis Centre by FS-ISAC</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  FS-ISAC, or the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Centre, is a global intelligence gathering and sharing initiative for the financial sector, with over 7000 members worldwide.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  The new center in Singapore will facilitate the sharing of cyberthreat information in a timely manner, and enable a rapid and coordinated response to emerging threats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, </span><b><i>MAS is reviewing its Technology Risk Management Guidelines</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We do this regularly, but this time we are doing it differently.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  For the first time, MAS is partnering the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) to co-create the guidelines.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  We will develop cyber risk management guidance </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the industry, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third, penetration testing. MAS already requires key financial institutions to conduct penetration testing of their cyber-defenses by independent third-parties. We need to go further.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  </span><b>MAS is partnering ABS to establish guidelines for “red-teaming,” to enhance cybersecurity testing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Red-teaming is a covert penetration test conducted on a financial institution’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">live </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">environment – its people, processes and technology – to assess their ability to respond to infiltration attempts.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  It will complement other forms of testing and assessments that are already in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I cannot emphasize enough how mission-critical cybersecurity is to the FinTech agenda.</span></p>
<h4><b>SOME POTENTIALLY TRANSFORMATIONAL FINTECH INITIATIVES</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have described our strategies. Let me now highlight five specific FinTech projects in Singapore that could potentially prove transformative in solving real-world problems.</span></p>
<h6><b>Enhancing Customer On-Boarding: KYC Utility</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, solving the “know-your-customer” (KYC) problem. KYC is one of the biggest pain points in the financial industry.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  It is an obligation in any customer on-boarding.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  But the process is costly, laborious, duplicative, and still not all that effective in detecting tax evasion or money laundering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government has taken the first step with MyInfo – a single platform containing personal data submitted to and verified by the government.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  MAS and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore have done a pilot with several banks to enable customers to open a bank account online using MyInfo.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  The pilot saw application timings shortened by as much as 80%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are now taking the next step. </span><b><i>MAS is working closely with local and foreign banks to explore a Banking KYC Shared-Services Utility that will streamline end-to-end KYC</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This means centralizing processes such as:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  leveraging on MyInfo for customer identification and verification;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  collecting and validating KYC documents; and<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  screening against sanctions and blacklists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Banking KYC Utility is potentially a transformative project.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  It will harmonize and enhance KYC checks across the industry.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  It will improve the quality of risk management while reducing cost and time taken.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  If all goes well, we hope to see the Utility in place next year.</span></p>
<h6><b>Making Trade Finance Safer and More Efficient: Global Trade Connectivity Network</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another area that could do with transformation is trade finance.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Today, it is largely paper-based. This is not only inefficient but increases risks such as fraud and duplicate invoicing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain technology offers good promise to make trade finance safer and more efficient.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Last year, DBS Bank and Standard Chartered Bank completed a proof-of-concept that demonstrated how blockchain technology could enable banks to detect if an invoice had already been financed.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Shortly after, HSBC and Bank of America did a proof-of-concept that showed how trade finance processes could be streamlined using blockchains and smart contracts.</span></p>
<p><b>Building on these, MAS and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will jointly develop the Global Trade Connectivity Network, a cross-border platform for trade finance using distributed ledger technology.</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  GTCN will be an open architecture platform that enables the seamless transfer of digital documents and data across borders, starting with the Singapore-Hong Kong trade corridor.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  If all goes well, we expect the GTCN to go live in early 2019.</span></p>
<p><b>Strengthening Supervision and Reducing Compliance Cost: SupTech</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not only the financial industry that needs FinTech but regulators as well.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  MAS has embarked on its own FinTech journey to make our supervision more effective and the compliance burden we impose less painful.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  We call it Supervisory Technology, or SupTech for short.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me give an example: detecting trade syndicates in the stock market.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  One of the most difficult things to detect in the market is collusive behavior and price manipulation.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  MAS has put in place a data analytics and pattern recognition system, to study trading behavior and detect accounts that may be:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> acting in concert to manipulate share prices, or<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> engaging in circular trading to create a false impression of market interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another example is that MAS is now working on a data analytics system to scour through the 3,000 “suspicious transaction reports,” or STRs, that financial institutions file each month on money laundering or terrorist financing risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major source of pain for financial institutions is regulators requesting for the same data more than once under different data collection exercises.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  We will fix this. </span><b>By taking a more cohesive approach to data, MAS will aim to achieve zero duplication in our data requests to financial institutions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  If we ask for the same data twice, the institution will be allowed to gently turn us down!<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  We will work with the industry on making this a reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And saving the best for the last: MAS will transform the way it collects data from financial institutions for supervisory purposes.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Today, financial institutions’ data submissions to MAS often involve manual processes to extract the information from their databases and fill up the MAS-provided form or template.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  And over at MAS, processing that data is also done manually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will make this more painless. </span><b><i>We have set a goal: all data requests from MAS will eventually be in machine-readable templates</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  The requested data will flow seamlessly from financial institutions’ databases to our forms and ultimately to the supervisory dashboards of MAS officers.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> No more “cut-and-paste.”</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  We will work with the industry on an implementation plan and a reasonable timeline.</span></p>
<h6><b>Making Cross-border Payments and Settlements Cheaper and Faster: Project Ubin</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, we must re-imagine a more efficient and secure way to conduct cross-border interbank payments and settlements.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Cross-border payments today rely on a correspondent banking network.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Banks hold balances with one another, and settlement occurs by adjusting these balances.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  There is counterparty risk, liquidity is split, and reconciliation is a major pain point.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Cross-border transactions often take days to settle, and at a high cost to customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the problem that Project Ubin seeks to solve using distributed ledger technology to enable entities across different jurisdictions to make payments directly to one another:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  without intermediaries;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  with much greater speed and efficiency, and<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  at lower cost and risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not an easy problem to solve, but we have made some progress.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Last year, Phase 1 demonstrated that banks could conduct inter-bank payments without going through MAS, using a blockchain-based digital representation of the Singapore Dollar.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Phase 2, just recently concluded, successfully produced three software prototypes that achieved decentralized netting of payments, in a manner that preserved transactional privacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAS has received keen interest in Project Ubin from many parties, including academia, and other central banks.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  We are committed to sharing what we have learned to encourage others to take a crack at solving this problem.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  We have just published the report on Phase 2.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  </span><b>More significantly, MAS will release publicly, free-of-charge, the source codes for all three successful prototypes from Project Ubin Phase 2.<br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Please take a look at the prototypes, study them, build upon them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s next? We are now preparing to extend Project Ubin beyond Singapore.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  </span><b>We are pleased to announce a collaboration on cross-border payments with the Bank of Canada using blockchain technology</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Deepening Financial Inclusion: ASEAN Financial Innovation Network</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we want to use FinTech to deepen financial inclusion across ASEAN.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  </span><b>MAS and the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation have teamed up to establish the ASEAN Financial Innovation Network (or “AFIN”)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  The goal of AFIN is to help banks and FinTechs in ASEAN collaborate, so as to broaden and deepen access to digital financial services across ASEAN.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AFIN is working on a cloud-based industry platform which will do three things:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  It will allow banks to search for and connect to innovative FinTech offerings.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  It will give FinTech firms an opportunity to scale up their business across borders.<br />
•  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will provide an industry sandbox to test out cross-border solutions. Regional regulators will be invited as observers of the sandbox.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of all, AFIN will provide a powerful platform to extend financial services to the millions of under-banked people in ASEAN.</span></p>
<h6><b>Conclusion</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singapore is on the FinTech journey because we want to make pervasive a culture of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">innovation </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in our financial sector. We must have:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  a restlessness to make things better,<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  a spirit of enterprise to try new ways,<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  a willingness to take manageable risks, and<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  the resilience to bounce back from failure to try again… and again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But FinTech must safeguard </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">trust </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">confidence</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Trust is the foundation for a market economy.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  In financial services and in the digital economy, it is absolutely critical.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Customers must have the confidence that systems are reliable, transactions are safe, their data are secure, and service offerings are in their best interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, everything we do in FinTech must have a larger </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">purpose</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ultimately, it must solve real-world problems, so that people’s lives are better off...</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  so that deserving small and medium enterprises can get financing to grow their businesses;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  so that migrant workers can send money back to their families cheaply, quickly, and securely;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  so that people can plan their finances holistically to meet their needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This room is filled with innovators, investors, business leaders, and policymakers from around the world.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Together, we can re-create finance with technology and innovation.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  As Tennyson puts it, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come, my friends, ‘tis not too late to seek a newer world."</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you!</span></p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><b>Singapore &amp; Bangalore, India </b><b>–</b><b> Nov 13, 2017</b><b> –</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Active.Ai, a Singapore-headquartered FinTech platform with an innovation lab in Bengaluru that delivers conversational banking through artificial intelligence (AI), announced a US $8.25 million Series A financing led by Vertex Ventures, Creditease Holdings, and Dream Incubator.

                <title>The Mother of All Regulators</title>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The utility for m-transactions will have to manage identity and provide relevant hooks for the movement of sensitive data amongst providers in the trusted ecosystem in real time and on a per-transaction basis. Effectively, one of the outcomes of such a utility will be the definition of a fair and sustainable business model, and separately, the basis for building a solution that can provide an appropriate level of customer support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the lack of a true cross-industry utility, and given the current environment of OEM-led fragmentation that is largely driving usability to suit its own interests, it is fairly obvious why we are struggling with both adoption and scale. The intelligentsia continues to be focused on relatively minor technology issues but there is no meaningful debate on how best we can collectively build this utility, only after which the next important step of building usability can commence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defining and eventually building this utility will not be a trivial undertaking. It is unlikely that such an undertaking – which will need so many different industries and regulators to come together – has been attempted before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as the utility needs cross-industry and regulatory cooperation, the usability will need a competitive marketplace. Solutions that offer true and sustainable value to the end-user will prevail, and those that do not will fade away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaboration across industry sectors possibly alongside like-minded regulators is best-suited for evolving the utility, its definition, or even better, a comprehensive specification with joint ownership that will ensure scale. Innovation and industry are best-suited to figure out usability – the solutions and their corresponding business models – that will drive adoption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some markets, individual providers may drive both utility and usability in a fragmented manner for its captive consumer base; and in other markets, the state may mandate the utility as well as usability solutions for its entire citizenry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The happy middle path that provides the right amount of innovation, choice, and protection to consumers, supported by a sustainable business model across the ecosystem of providers, will be left for each market to chart for itself based on its own socioeconomic considerations. The key will be to understand this distinction between utility and usability – its symbiotic relationship where one supports the other, and yet needs separate definition and sustenance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulators will need to be involved across the spectrum, providing much-needed oversight and enforcing compliance. Just like everything else, the key here will also be to ensure that they have the light touch that encourages innovators as well as the strong arm that repels violators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether numerous existing agencies come together as a single cohesive regulatory body, or a brand new regulatory regime evolves, the guiding principle for the-mother-of-all-regulators will be to define and deploy a cross-industry utility that will ensure scale, upon which a highly innovative usability environment can then help drive adoption, collectively addressing all the relevant technology, business and compliance issues related to seamless and secure personalized transactions.</span></p>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LTP Team had the pleasure of speaking with </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpeled/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel Peled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a serial entrepreneur and the Founder &amp; CEO of PayKey, a company that enables payments within any social network – PayKey enables mobile users to access financial services from within any application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of October 2017, PayKey </span><a href="http://paykey.com/703-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the official closing of its $10 million Series B funding round, led by MizMaa, and joined by SBI Group, Digital Ventures – the FinTech subsidiary of Siam Commercial Bank, SixThirty, Fintech71, the FinLab, and additional new &amp; existing investors. The funding will be used to accelerate PayKey’s global expansion and to continue developing new solutions. This round brings the total invested in the company to $16 million.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source: PayKey</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayKey has seen impressive early traction, already counting Westpac in Australia, Davivienda in Columbia, UOB in Singapore (</span><a href="http://www.uob.com.sg/personal/ebanking/mykey.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UOB became the first bank in Singapore to let users send money using any messaging app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), Garanti in Turkey, SpareBank in Norway, and Bank Leumi in Israel as customers. The company expects to more than double the number of customers in the next six months, with one of the world’s largest banks in the world due to go live with PayKey by the end of the year. The company has previously seen support from leading financial institutions, counting Mastercard, Santander InnoVentures, and CommerzVentures as existing investors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope you enjoy our conversation with Daniel as much as we did! </span></p>
<p><b>LTP: Daniel, please tell us about yourself.</b></p>
<p><b>Daniel Peled: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m an entrepreneur and a blockchain enthusiast. I hold a dual degree in Law &amp; Economics and LLM from the University of Haifa, and am responsible for the strategy, vision and team management at </span><a href="http://www.paykey.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayKey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP: Give us a paragraph pitch of your company.</b></p>
<p><b>DP: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">With PayKey, banks can increase brand engagement by transforming the keyboard into a new channel for financial services, information, and communication. PayKey bridges the gap between banking and social, enabling banks to have their brands become a part of their customers’ social and messaging experience. PayKey enables banks to provide their customers with the ability to initiate and complete a range of financial services, including P2P payments, request payment, balance check, chatbot engagement, cardless withdrawal, and more, from within any mobile application. Offering a cross-platform banking button on the smartphone’s keyboard boosts the bank’s brand engagement while making the banking experience quick, contextual, and simple for users.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP: In a sentence or two, what problems are you solving today?</b></p>
<p><b>DP: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks are battling to remain relevant as they face an unprecedented competitive environment coupled with changing consumer expectations for instantaneous, highly-efficient, and seamless financial experiences. In a time where consumers expect to access services from any channel at any time, we are helping banks to improve their user experience and boost their brand engagement by enabling their customers to access financial services from within any mobile application.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP: Who are you selling to?</b></p>
<p><b>DP: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are selling our fully customizable white label solution to any bank around the world that is looking to offer their customers a superior, channel-agnostic banking experience.</span></p>
<p><b>LTP: How does PayKey differentiate itself from competitors?</b></p>
<p><b>DP: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayKey’s offering is very unique, as we offer a white label solution that integrates with the bank’s existing mobile application. Most of our competitors are focusing on building “private garden” solutions that work only within their application. Our solution is platform-agnostic, white labeled and works within any application (messengers, email, social networks, etc.).</span></p>
<p><b>LTP: Your next milestone?</b></p>
<p><b>DP: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have seven commercial deals signed with major banks around the world, with a huge pipeline of potential customers. Our goal over the next year is to close more deals and to continue expanding our customer base internationally.</span></p>

                <title>Daily Review: Alternative Lending Shows Positive Momentum – Q3 Earnings Reports</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/fintech/insights/lending/2017/11/10/alternative-lending-shows-positive-momentum-q3-earnings-reports/</link>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business lending has traditionally been dominated by institutional players. Over the past several years, however, a gap in SME financing has been taken close to the heart by technology giants and startups alike. "There are a number of tech companies that do small business lending in varying degrees," Rania Succar, Head of QuickBooks Capital at Intuit, told CNBC. "For example Square, PayPal and Amazon offer loans to merchants."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Federal Reserve, only </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/07/intuit-unveils-business-lending-product-quickbooks-capital.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">23%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of businesses younger than five years get access to credit, which created a perfect environment for proliferation of alternative lenders. In fact, lending (along with payments) has long been </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/global-fintech-funding-36-bn-2016/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the most well-funded and represented segment in FinTech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lending has become an extremely competitive space </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies for which it was never the primary focus are getting started with their own business financing arms (Intuit, </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/31/marketinvoice-launches-business-loans-on-back-of-psd2-open-banking.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MarketInvoice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Meanwhile, positive momentum in Q3 earning results of more established players draws a promising future for the whole segment that has seen its share of hardships.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lending Club sees a healthy Q3 </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Q3 loan originations hit a six-quarter high of $2.4 billion, up 14% from $2.1 billion in Q2, and 20% from $2 billion in Q3 2016.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Q3 revenue hit a record high of $154 million, up 10% from $140 million in Q2, and 34% from $115 million in last year's quarter. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The revenue boost helped consolidated net losses narrow to $6.7 million from $25.4 million in Q2, and $36.5 million in Q3 2016.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Lending Club continued to expand its securitization program to build out an additional revenue stream. It has also begun implementing an updated credit model that better reflects current economy and protects investor yields. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Although Lending Club's latest results fell below analysts' expectations, they nevertheless demonstrated a continued upward trajectory. </span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Square facilitated 47,000 business loans totaling $303 million, up 45% YoY. In comparison, during Q2 2017, Square Capital originated over 49,000 SME loans of $318 million.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The past summer, Square launched a pilot of ‘Square Installments,’ a product that is integrated with Square Invoices. This credit offering allows a seller’s customers to finance purchases over several months.</span></li>

                <title>Insurers Will Still Be Relevant in the Future, Even More Than Yesterday</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/insights/insurance/insurtech/2017/11/10/insurers-will-still-be-relevant-in-future-even-more-than-yesterday/</link>
                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>The insurance sector is now seeing the same dynamics already experienced in many other sectors, including financial services: with startups and other tech firms innovating one or more steps of the value chain traditionally belonging to financial institutions.</p>
<p>InsurTech has seen extremely important investments in the last few years, and the word “disruption” is coming up frequently in the insurance debates. But I consider it a joke for an industry conference to show a picture of a newborn and sell it as the last intermediary or the last client to have purchased an insurance policy.</p>
<p>One UK insurer more than addressed the claims related to the obesity of the insured dogs. They invented a value proposition that provides the insurance coverage adding all the preventive treatments your dog needs: a monthly box delivered at your home with the accessories and the food that your specific dog needs and a pet tracker to nudge you to make him exercise more.</p>
<p>Moving to insurance for humans, South African insurer Discovery demonstrates incredible innovations. Over the last 20 years, the insurer has introduced new ways to improve policyholders’ lives using connected fitness devices to track healthy behaviors, generate discounts, and deliver incentives for activities supporting wellness and even healthy food purchases.</p>
<p>Insurers were able to imagine and execute this exceptional of innovations. For this reason, I’m positive about the future of the sector. I’m convinced that insurance companies will still be relevant in the future, or will become even more relevant than they are now, but these companies will have to be InsurTechs or players who use technology as the main enablers for reaching their own strategic objectives.</p>
<p>Insurance IoT is one of the first InsurTech trends to come of age. Sensors have become a ubiquitous part of everyday life, expanding our world to include people and businesses around the world even while they connect us ever more intimately with those nearby and even with ourselves, as well as with our homes, workplaces, possessions, and increasingly, insurers. Today, there is more than one connected device per person in the world, and by some analysts' estimate, 50 devices for a family of four by 2022. The insurance sector cannot stop this trend; it can only figure out how to deal with it.</p>
<p>“Connected insurance” is the name of that game: insurance solutions using sensors to collect data on the state of an insured risk, and telematics for remote transmission and management of that data. Auto telematics is the most mature use case but there are relevant innovative initiatives both on home and health insurance.</p>
<p>Connected insurance is affecting the whole insurance value chain and generating real value for insurance P&amp;L. The five main value creation levers are:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Behavior “steering” programs, leading the client toward less-risky behaviors so reducing their claims;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Value-added services, developing client-tailored ancillary services that allow the insurer to deliver enlarged value propositions,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Loss control, developing a broad approach to reduce claim costs:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">a. acting directly on the single situation to mitigating the risk before the damage happens and containing the damage in real time<br />
b. anticipating the claims management and improving reimbursement valuation<br />
c. improving the efficiency of the claims process</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Risk selection, creating value proposition able to attract less-risky clients, improving the quality of the underwriting process based on the sensors’ data, or increasing the efficiency of the underwriting process</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">5. Dynamic risk-based pricing, developing insurance policies with pricing linked to clients' individual risks and behaviors – reducing premium leakages on one side and offering low-risk individuals lower prices on the other, increasing their retention and acquiring many of them.</p>
<p>The connected insurance paradigm is based on value sharing. In any business lines, insurers can, on one side, use the data from connected devices to generate a value on the insurance P&amp;L and, on the other side, build value propositions focused on sharing this value through incentives, services, and discounts. The value creation equations will become more and more articulated with the diffusion of those approaches on the market, but that scenario will be characterized by relevant value sharing also with the society. You can figure out the level of positive externalities generated by an insurance sector able to change behaviors and prevent risks.</p>
<p>Extensive discussions with more than 50 insurers, reinsurers and tech players on the insurance IoT opportunity led me to believe that the five levers mentioned above allow the insurance carrier to exploit the value of the IoT data on their P&amp;L. This approach represents a unique competitive advantage compared to any other players in the IoT arena. This way, the insurance carriers will stay relevant or will become more relevant than ever.</p>
<p>The benefits for the insurance sector in adopting this paradigm also include the increased frequency of interaction with the customer – a proven way to earn greater loyalty – and the unique opportunity to build knowledge about the customers and their risks.</p>
<p>It is a pity to hear a futurologist at an InsurTech conference figuring out the insurance IoT use cases as an AI within the connected home buying insurance via smart contracts when the fridge needs maintenance, or an AI within a wearable watch buying insurance via smart contracts in case you are injured playing basketball. This will not be insurance: there isn't risk transfer or randomness (accidental and unintentional loss).</p>
<p>Instead, the business model and even the role of insurance companies are enlarged by this technology evolution, not changed. The essence of the insurance sector – since its origin on 1347 – was assessing, managing and transferring risks but the direct results of the technology adoption are “superpowers” to do the same things much better.</p>

                    <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Pay Cash – Another Manifest to Apple's Core Values</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entering the P2P payments game relatively late, Apple definitely makes the right moves to strengthen its closed ecosystem – the company paired its payment solution with the iMessage platform, enabling a seamless experience within an existing channel instead of pushing to download another app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Pay Cash is another manifest to Apple's core values. With this move and its execution, Apple brings into life its worship for convenience, superior user experience and a strong herding of Apple product users that comes with integration into a naturally used channel in the Apple universe. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">iPhone Owners Can Now Send Money to Friends Using Apple Pay Cash</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Apple smartphones are now able to send money to people using its Apple Pay Cash feature, which </span><a href="http://fortune.com/2017/06/06/apple-venmo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was announced in June</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and released in iOS 11.2 Beta</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  $1 is the minimum transfer amount. Funding an Apple Pay Cash account requires adding a minimum of $10. Users can't make a transaction higher than $3,000. Users cannot add more than $10,000 during a 7-day period and Apple Pay Cash accounts cannot hold a balance higher than $20,000.</span></p>

<hr />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demonetization in India has been one of the most-discussed and significant events in the past year. In a strong push towards less-cash society, the government now witnesses an important implication – educational, and transformational for an established mindset. At the end of the day, the mindset of transformation will be the strongest force behind a widespread adoption of cashless operations. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Demonetisation made people understand mobile payments"</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Before demonetisation, we used to see about 50 million transactions a month. A year after demonetisation, we are seeing about 200 million transactions a month, which is a growth of four times on an average number basis. In between, there was a point where we had crossed 260-270 million monthly transactions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"But what demonetization did is not about this. The mindset of the people has changed; there is a shift. We are moving away from being cash-first. Today, if you don’t have cash, and you need to pay somebody, they will simply say why don’t you Paytm me? I believe, we have become part of the mainstream and that I think is pretty incredible." – Paytm Founder &amp; CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/demonetisation-made-people-understand-mobile-payments/article19999095.ece"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on <em>The Hindu.</em></span></p>
<hr />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the mindset changes, the first results of demonetization show – payments using mobile wallets almost doubled in the one-year post demonetization, clocking $1 billion per month in 2017.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile leading the way: Wallet payments almost double in one year in India</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Demonetization resulted in a huge jump in mobile wallet usage immediately after the announcement. Follow-up initiatives from the government, from mobile wallet players, and new initiatives from tech giants, were responsible for maintaining the steady flow in digital payments.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Payments using mobile wallets almost doubled in the one-year post demonetization, clocking $1 billion per month in 2017. They contributed 8.3% (1.6 billion) of the overall volume and 0.02% (US$7 billion) of the overall value of the Indian digital financial system in 2016. M-wallets are expected to surpass 3.1 billion transactions worth more than US$13 billion in 2017.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  With the increase in smartphone penetration as well mobile broadband connectivity, India will largely skip the use of credit and debit cards and move instead to an environment where mobile payments become the largest form of non-cash payments. This process will be quicker compared to other countries like China, mainly because of the following factors: a) Digital India initiatives, b) Increase of 4G data network availability, c) Aggressive mobile wallet strategy. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Paytm is leading the mobile wallet race with a reported user base of 250 million. Paytm enjoyed the first-mover advantage with an aggressive push, marketing discounts, and cashback strategies. Mobikwik ranks second among the top mobile wallets in India, with 65 million users and 3 million daily transactions. The efforts of the top two players are largely concentrated in the top eight cities. Other players like Oxygen are focused on remittances, while players like Ezetap are concentrating on last mile payment solutions for e-commerce.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Mobile wallets are expected to see further penetration in rural India using methods like QR code and mobile number payments.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Going forward, the competition will be even tougher: WhatsApp is set to enter the fray by offering P2P payments through its messaging app. The adoption of Google’s Tez app might also play a significant role as the Android operating system completely dominates the Indian smartphone market.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tele-talk/mobile-leading-the-way-wallet-payments-almost-double-in-one-year-in-india/2693"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on <em>Telecom (the Economic Times).</em></span></p>
<hr />

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Banks Show Major P2P Payment Growth</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  For banks, one of the major problems in gaining traction with P2P payments has been a fragmented market. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  PayPal has become the envy of the financial world with its P2P payments success: In its most recent quarter, P2P payments grew to $24 billion across PayPal's platforms, good for a 47% increase YoY, and P2P payments now represent 21% of PayPal's $114 billion total payment volume. Venmo also continues to show explosive growth – in PayPal's Q3, Venmo processed about $9 billion in payments, a 93% YoY increase. In its recently reported quarter, PayPal reported 1.9 billion transactions across its platforms, a 26% increase YoY. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  As banks saw consumer habits changing, they knew they would have to adapt or risk losing the next generation of consumers. Zelle was their collective solution. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan said the bank had seen "significant growth" in both the number of P2P transactions and payment volume since launching Zelle in June. Sloan also said the company saw 46% growth YoY in P2P payments.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  "In this quarter, Zelle came forward, the latest offering we have in (the) mobile area. ... [O]ur volumes through Zelle this quarter were $4 billion in the third quarter. We processed nearly 14 million transactions, and the growth continues. We recently processed $0.5 billion in a single week. Our customers are using Zelle, and we look forward to further growth in that area," said Brian Moynihan, CEO at Bank of America.</span></p>

<hr />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, and Facebook will allow people outside of the US to send money using its messenger app for the first time as it offers mobile payments in the UK. While in the US, Facebook certainly has some competition to measure up to – the UK market is a less competitive market at the moment for small-scale payments. </span><a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/359005-facebook-to-make-mobile-payments-available-in-uk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on <em>The Hill.</em></span></p>

                <title>2018: Innovation Is a Corporate Game, Not Startup [Curated Content]</title>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to develop and adopt hi-tech has been widely attributed to the startup community rather than to corporate players. The year 2018 will be very different – corporations are gradually taking over the game by either aggressively pressuring startups in developing niches, or by monopolizing the areas of advanced technologies applications by democratizing their adoption. Prices will fall, technology will get more accessible to businesses, and the startup community will face not only peer pressure but a revival of corporate players that are exploring new niches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A series of latest important news suggest that innovation in 2018 may become a corporate game, not a startup, which is dictated by the </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tendayiviki/2017/11/07/how-creating-an-entrepreneurship-function-can-help-sustain-corporate-innovation/#12a935fc12a6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that "with the rapid pace of technological changes and disruption from startups, large corporations are under increasing pressure to respond with innovation."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon is taking over industries at the speed of light. Now, the company is further rooting in the payments space with its latest partnership, 7-Eleven (added to CVS, Speedway, and GameStop, along with a handful of other supermarket chains and convenience stores).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Cash, the service that lets you use cash to shop Amazon online, arrives at 7-Eleven</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Amazon Cash, the service that lets consumers add cash to their Amazon.com balance at brick-and-mortar retailers, is now available at nearly 8,000 7-Eleven convenience stores.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Cash customers represent 27% of consumers. These customers may not be regularly shopping online due to the need to use credit or debit cards at checkout.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Allowing customers to use cash to pay is only way retailers are targeting this market. This year, both Walmart and Amazon made it easier for customers on government assistance to shop on their sites and use their services, too.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  To use Amazon Cash at a 7-Eleven, customers present a personalized barcode found in their Amazon app to the cashier along with the money they want to load. The barcode also can be sent via a text or printed. The cashier then scans the barcode, which immediately adds the funds to the customer’s account balance on Amazon.com.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Customers can load between $15 and $500 in a single transaction, with no fees.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  7-Eleven also carries Amazon prepaid gift cards in denominations from $25 to $500.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  7-Eleven operates, franchises or licenses 10,900 stores in the US and Canada. This launch covers a majority of 7-Eleven’s US footprint. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tencent is reportedly testing its own autonomous driving system</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Tencent, one of China’s largest tech firms and the maker of WeChat, already has a prototype and is testing the system internally.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  If the company's autonomous driving tests go well, it would help Tencent catch up with fellow Chinese tech giant and rival Baidu, which recently launched a $1.5 billion investment fund as part of Apollo, its autonomous vehicle initiative, and plans to mass produce Level 4 self-driving cars by 2021 with BAIC Group.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Tencent recently announced an alliance to work on AI technology for autonomous cars. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walmart Pay 'Close to Surpassing' Apple Pay in US Mobile Payments Usage</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Available nationwide in 4,774 Walmart stores, Walmart Pay is "close to surpassing" Apple Pay in terms of mobile payments usage in the US. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Walmart Pay is enrolling tens of thousands of new users a day and has seen a steady growth over the past few months. Two-thirds of those who try it use it again within 21 days. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  "Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s app is close to surpassing Apple Pay in usage for mobile payments in the US, giving the world’s largest retailer even more clout as a growing number of people shop with their smartphones."  - Daniel Eckert, SVP of Walmart Services &amp; Digital Acceleration.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Walmart Pay is predicted to grow bigger than Apple Pay in active US users (who use the mobile wallets for at least two transactions per month) by the end of 2018.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Walmart began gaining ground on Apple earlier in 2017, when 5.1% of Walmart shoppers said they used Walmart Pay this past June, just below the 5.5% of iPhone users who said the same at locations that accept Apple Pay. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Walmart Pay's adoption rate is "higher than Samsung Pay and Android Pay combined." This is likely because Walmart owns and controls the mobile wallet software and can make quick changes.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Walmart is more interested in directly competing with Amazon than Apple. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft is a very interesting corporate player that underwent a significant transformation of its image and work. The year 2018 will be a year of Microsoft 2.0 as the company is silently but surely working on an important tech that could potentially transform payments/shopping experience – Keyset Fingerprint Sensor – a fingerprint sensor in a computer’s keyboard that enables a user to press a key to conduct biometric authentication. Old is the new <em>new</em>. With this patent, Microsoft seeks to tie authentication to its devices, locking out competitive security solutions. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Patents Fingerprint Authentication Sensor in Keyboard, Touchscreens</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Microsoft is seeking to build fingerprint sensors into touchscreens and keyboards to authenticate users. For advertising, e-commerce and search, the technology could potentially provide the same type of data as eye tracking only through fingerprint sensors.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Two separate patents were updated or granted in 2017. </span></p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>The ability to develop and adopt hi-tech has been widely attributed to the startup community rather than to corporate players. The year 2018 will be very different – corporations are gradually taking over the game by either aggressively pressuring startups in developing niches, or by monopolizing the areas of advanced technologies applications by democratizing their adoption. Prices will fall, technology will get more accessible to businesses, and the startup community will face not only peer pressure but a revival of corporate players that are exploring new niches.</p>

<p>A series of latest important news suggest that innovation in 2018 may become a corporate game, not a startup, which is dictated by the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tendayiviki/2017/11/07/how-creating-an-entrepreneurship-function-can-help-sustain-corporate-innovation/#12a935fc12a6">vision</a> that “with the rapid pace of technological changes and disruption from startups, large corporations are under increasing pressure to respond with innovation.”</p>

<p>Amazon is taking over industries at the speed of light. Now, the company is further rooting in the payments space with its latest partnership, 7-Eleven (added to CVS, Speedway, and GameStop, along with a handful of other supermarket chains and convenience stores).</p>

<h2 id="amazon-cash-the-service-that-lets-you-use-cash-to-shop-amazon-online-arrives-at-7-eleven">Amazon Cash, the service that lets you use cash to shop Amazon online, arrives at 7-Eleven</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Amazon Cash, the service that lets consumers add cash to their Amazon.com balance at brick-and-mortar retailers, is now available at nearly 8,000 7-Eleven convenience stores.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cash customers represent 27% of consumers. These customers may not be regularly shopping online due to the need to use credit or debit cards at checkout.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allowing customers to use cash to pay is only way retailers are targeting this market. This year, both Walmart and Amazon made it easier for customers on government assistance to shop on their sites and use their services, too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To use Amazon Cash at a 7-Eleven, customers present a personalized barcode found in their Amazon app to the cashier along with the money they want to load. The barcode also can be sent via a text or printed. The cashier then scans the barcode, which immediately adds the funds to the customer’s account balance on Amazon.com.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Customers can load between $15 and $500 in a single transaction, with no fees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>7-Eleven also carries Amazon prepaid gift cards in denominations from $25 to $500.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>7-Eleven operates, franchises or licenses 10,900 stores in the US and Canada. This launch covers a majority of 7-Eleven’s US footprint.</p>
  </li>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Tencent, one of China’s largest tech firms and the maker of WeChat, already has a prototype and is testing the system internally.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the company’s autonomous driving tests go well, it would help Tencent catch up with fellow Chinese tech giant and rival Baidu, which recently launched a $1.5 billion investment fund as part of Apollo, its autonomous vehicle initiative, and plans to mass produce Level 4 self-driving cars by 2021 with BAIC Group.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tencent recently announced an alliance to work on AI technology for autonomous cars.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tencent’s auto and driving-related investments include Nio, Didi Chuxing, and a 5% stake in Tesla.</p>

<h2 id="walmart-pay-close-to-surpassing-apple-pay-in-us-mobile-payments-usage">Walmart Pay ‘Close to Surpassing’ Apple Pay in US Mobile Payments Usage</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Available nationwide in 4,774 Walmart stores, Walmart Pay is “close to surpassing” Apple Pay in terms of mobile payments usage in the US.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Walmart Pay is enrolling tens of thousands of new users a day and has seen a steady growth over the past few months. Two-thirds of those who try it use it again within 21 days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s app is close to surpassing Apple Pay in usage for mobile payments in the US, giving the world’s largest retailer even more clout as a growing number of people shop with their smartphones.” – Daniel Eckert, SVP of Walmart Services &amp; Digital Acceleration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Walmart Pay is predicted to grow bigger than Apple Pay in active US users (who use the mobile wallets for at least two transactions per month) by the end of 2018.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Walmart began gaining ground on Apple earlier in 2017, when 5.1% of Walmart shoppers said they used Walmart Pay this past June, just below the 5.5% of iPhone users who said the same at locations that accept Apple Pay.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Walmart Pay’s adoption rate is “higher than Samsung Pay and Android Pay combined.” This is likely because Walmart owns and controls the mobile wallet software and can make quick changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Walmart is more interested in directly competing with Amazon than Apple.</p>

<p>Microsoft is a very interesting corporate player that underwent a significant transformation of its image and work. The year 2018 will be a year of Microsoft 2.0 as the company is silently but surely working on an important tech that could potentially transform payments/shopping experience – Keyset Fingerprint Sensor – a fingerprint sensor in a computer’s keyboard that enables a user to press a key to conduct biometric authentication. Old is the new new. With this patent, Microsoft seeks to tie authentication to its devices, locking out competitive security solutions.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-patents-fingerprint-authentication-sensor-in-keyboard-touchscreens">Microsoft Patents Fingerprint Authentication Sensor in Keyboard, Touchscreens</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Microsoft is seeking to build fingerprint sensors into touchscreens and keyboards to authenticate users. For advertising, e-commerce and search, the technology could potentially provide the same type of data as eye tracking only through fingerprint sensors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two separate patents were updated or granted in 2017.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first patent, Microsoft received a patent for an under-display fingerprint sensor originally filed in July 2016.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another Microsoft patent that would put a fingerprint sensor in the keys of computer keyboards would not only impact digital identification &amp; authentication but also e-commerce and advertising.</p>

                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Bank and credit union data is incredibly useful and almost everyone in the industry needs it. You can find potential customers, leverage it for investment banking, competitive analysis, due diligence, and monitoring the health of the industry. Finding financial institution (FI) data seems pretty straightforward – a good amount is publicly reported. However, once you start digging, you will find that it’s not that easy. The dominant provider of this data is SNL Finance, which was acquired by S&amp;P Global for $2.23 billion in 2015.</p>

<p>As with anything in FinServ and FinTech, we like to ask ourselves: who is challenging the old guard? That’s how I got to know <a href="http://fedfis.com/">FedFis</a>, an FI data provider from Austin (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/explaining-how-we-capture-data-fintegration-ecosystemc-dave-mayo/">FinTech Cowboys</a>). After learning more about the company, I thought you should know about them too. Typically, this type of story would involve me calling up FedFis’ CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-mayo-7731921/">Dave Mayo</a> (<a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/exclusive-interview-with-dave-mayo-ceo-of-fedfis/">someone I’ve got to know over the last year</a>), but I didn’t do that. Instead, I spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/walt-boyer-66772842/">Walt Boyer</a>, who leads investment banking at Mundial Financial Group. Walt has decades of banking experience (37 years, but who’s counting?) and has worked first-hand with data from SNL and FedFis.</p>

<p>I wanted to know why he uses FedFis. Walt and I spoke for about 45 minutes so I’ve edited our conversation for brevity and clarity to highlight why FI data and FedFis are worth your attention.</p>

<h2 id="the-80s-fi-data-history">The ’80s: FI Data History</h2>

<p>The ’80s were an interesting decade for banking (deregulation, regulation, S&amp;L crisis, etc.). Walt sets the stage:</p>

<p>“In the mid-‘80s, there was a lot of bank turmoil in the industry, so the regulators and others wanted to be sure that you as a bank were protecting your bank from the negative condition of another financial institution. If you are a commercial bank, you are required to monitor your bank’s exposure to other banking institutions. You’re supposed to be able to measure or gauge the intensity of that exposure, recognize if certain degradation happens, and have a plan to protect your bank. That meant that we needed more financial data on financial institutions.</p>

<p>We were left asking ourselves: ‘How do we measure the banks? How do we recognize and compare a bank’s financial condition – their capital ratios, thresholds, and when to take action?’ It made sense and I wish we were there about 10 years earlier.”</p>

<h2 id="fintech-before-fintech">FinTech before FinTech</h2>

<p>FinTech isn’t new; it’s just different. Data/actionable information about banks was every bit as useful in the ’80s as it is today. One of the more fascinating things about Dave Mayo, FedFis’ CEO, is that he’s been helping create the banking data ecosystem for almost four decades. Walt continues:</p>

<p>“The introduction of technology, like personal computers, meant bank data was delivered not in hard copy and bound books but on floppy disks (and later, over the internet). Early on in this process, I met Dave because he was delivering the early versions of bank information systems. He had a unique ability to recognize the needs of his customers and deliver the data that fit my needs.”</p>

<h2 id="the-switch">The Switch</h2>

<p>The next two decades of Walt’s career took him to Amegy Bank, <a href="http://www.kbw.com/">Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods</a>, and <a href="https://www.alvarezandmarsal.com/">Alvarez &amp; Marsal</a> where he leveraged SNL for financial data in his M&amp;A, investment banking, and broker-dealer activities. After joining a startup broker-dealer, Mundial Financial Group, Walt needed financial data and naturally wanted to implement what he was familiar with (SNL) but couldn’t afford it, so he turned to Dave.</p>

<p>“I don’t care how old you are, switching to something new after 15 years isn’t easy. At first, I had to think about it in the old system [SNL]. It would have been hard but having the FedFis team hold my hand and walk me through it helped a lot.</p>

<p>“After we got through the initial training, we recognized that FedFis’ data was remarkably thorough – we had all the same core data. I was pleasantly surprised at how experienced FedFis are at understanding how we did things in the old system, like financial models, and moving it over to his platform getting the same result.</p>

<p>“Also, in the cases where we couldn’t make an exact replacement, the team helped us recognize where you can get the data and find new innovative information. Plus, you save a ton of money and also sleep well at night knowing that, you know, once a year, you’re not going to get some phone call that you dread where you’re going to have to adjust your budgets for the next five years.” [Note: I was quite surprised to find out that FedFis guarantees your price will not increase.]</p>

<h2 id="fintegration-ecosystem">Fintegration Ecosystem</h2>

<p>Admittedly, as soon as I heard “Fintegration Ecosystem,” my interest was piqued. The world of banking data, its uses, and how difficult it is to maintain was enlightening; however, the culmination of 30 years of financial services data coming together with FinTech data of today seemed unique. Walt put it in perspective:</p>

<p>“Something that I have not seen in any other bank data service provider is their Fintegration Ecosystem. Yeah, it’s a mouthful. In short, they are able to provide data on financial institutions’ vendor relationships like core processors, online banking providers, and merchant services.</p>

<p>“I wish I had that 12 years ago when I was a commercial banker doing M&amp;A buy-side deals, because one of the things that really helps you sharpen your pencil with regard to what consideration you can pay for an acquisition is how expensive and successful will a conversion be in terms of compatibility, contractual obligations to vendors, and potential merger issues.”</p>

<h2 id="been-there-done-that-what-you-can-learn">Been there, done that: What you can learn.</h2>

<p>FinTech, and technology in general, has an obsession with the youth and what’s new. We shouldn’t ignore the new tools at our disposal – be it mobile, blockchain, or machine learning – talking to Walt about FedFis and Dave Mayo made me think about the key to a company’s success.</p>

<p>After almost four decades of pushing the envelope in providing banking data, Walt attributed FedFis’ success to the ethics of the people on the team. It gave him confidence that they can just “go about their business.” It was one of the highest compliments and perhaps, a sign of a company that truly understands its customers.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singapore's FinTech is on the way to global leadership</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/singapores-fintech-industry-global-leadership/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singapore</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the gems of the global financial services industry ecosystem with ~200 banks with total assets of $2 trillion having operational headquarters in the city. Global financial institutions like </span><a href="http://newsroom.mastercard.com/press-releases/mastercard-to-launch-singapore-innovation-rd-center/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mastercard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.ubs.com/magazines/innovation/en/about-us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UBS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/dbs-invests-7-1-million-to-build-a-silicon-valley-in-singapore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DBS Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/ocbc-bank-launches-fintech-innovation-lab-in-singapore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OCBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://thefinlab.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UOB,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/citiforcities/home_articles/n_singapore.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citigroup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have already launched their </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/88-international-startup-accelerators-incubators-innovation-labs-nurturing-innovators-in-financial-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">innovation labs and accelerators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Singapore along with significant investments in the ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singapore has one of the most forward-thinking governing authorities in the financial services industry internationally. To support the development of a vibrant FinTech ecosystem (there are </span><a href="http://directory.singaporefintech.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">400+ FinTech Startups</span> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">incorporated in Singapore), MAS has taken steps to ensure Singapore’s leading position as a leading global FinTech hub: those include </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/singapore-fintech-festival-fintech-hubs-flight-to-the-top/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">committing S$225 million under the Financial Sector Technology &amp; Innovation (FSTI) scheme;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the launch of the FinTech and Innovation Group (FTIG) and the FinTech Office; creation of a </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/international-fintech-regulatory-sandboxes-launched-by-forward-thinking-financial-authorities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech regulatory sandbox;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a move towards an open-API architecture; the “Singapore Payment Roadmap,” and the opening of the MAS’ FinTech innovation lab – the “Looking Glass @ MAS,” amongst other first-of-their-kind initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only does Singapore offer the most fertile ground for innovators to launch and test their solutions, </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/singapore-is-shaping-up-to-become-the-blockchain-center-of-the-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the country is also paving its way into becoming the blockchain center of the world</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the end of October, </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sopnendu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sopnendu Mohanty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Chief FinTech Officer of MAS, announced that </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/26/singapore-cryptocurrency-blockchain-trial.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singapore will conclude its experiment with blockchain technology and its own digital currency in 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before deciding whether to commercialize the trial. In 2016, MAS announced </span><a href="http://www.mas.gov.sg/Singapore-Financial-Centre/Smart-Financial-Centre/Project-Ubin.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Project Ubin,"</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an exploration of DLT. Now, the MAS trial is looking at delivering securities, cross-border payments and, finally, using a digital version of the Singapore dollar to carry out real </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">transactions and buy assets. Several major banks – including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Credit Suisse – are involved in the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-magic-of-open-apis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open APIs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not just a concept for financial institutions in Singapore. A number of banks have embraced this wonderful opportunity, and OCBC Bank is one of the leaders in this field via its </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/leading-api-bandwagon-apac-connect2ocbc-story/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connect2OCBC platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – an open API platform – and the vast set of transactional APIs that was released for the external developer community. Connect2OCBC was launched in May 2016, an initiative that made OCBC Bank become the first bank in Southeast Asia to launch an open API platform. This platform enables external developers and FinTech players to collaborate with OCBC Bank as an innovation partner. It also helps them to develop unique applications that will add value to OCBC’s customers. This essentially is a clarion call to the creative technological talent available in the market to join forces with OCBC Bank and take a step towards digital, open banking. The efforts made by the Singapore government to cultivate a “Smart Nation,” along with a regulatory environment that encourages innovation, have helped OCBC Bank plug into the “open data economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the launch, OCBC has received more than </span><a href="http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/banking-finance/dbs-launches-worlds-largest-banking-api-developer-platform"><span style="font-weight: 400;">150,000 APIs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calls or requests across all its APIs. The bank was also the first in Singapore to launch a transactional API for GIRO, setup in September 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another major institution – </span><a href="http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/banking-finance/dbs-launches-worlds-largest-banking-api-developer-platform"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DBS – launched the world's largest banking API developer platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the beginning of November, boasting of 50+ successful collaborations. All in all, DBS has launched 155 APIs for Singapore across more than 20 categories; more categories will be added in response to demand.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-gledhill-52142036/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Gledhill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, DBS Group CIO, </span><a href="http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/banking-finance/dbs-launches-worlds-largest-banking-api-developer-platform"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> "DBS embarked on a journey to transform our tech infrastructure nine years ago. With that early start, we are now ahead of many others in being digital to the core. This has given us an edge – enabling us to operate with FinTech-like ability and nimbleness, and also platform-like inclusiveness."</span></p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>SecurionPay extends services to forex and partners with XTB</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X-Trade Brokers Brokerage House, a world leader in FX and CFD trading publicly </span><a href="https://www.gpw.pl/company-factsheet?isin=PLXTRDM00011"><span style="font-weight: 400;">listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has teamed up with SecurionPay, a Swiss-based payment platform for global card payments processing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SecurionPay has quickly become a partner of choice for many European businesses within various industries and has now opened its platform to forex as well. XTB chose the Swiss platform as their payment partner for its versatile APIs and unique technological solutions that meet XTB’s fast-growing business needs and global presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more than 14 years of experience, XTB allows their clients to trade with confidence. With this strategic partnership, the brokerage house takes a leap forward in delivering its clients fast, secure and convenient payment possibilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been looking for a solution with top-notch technology that will make us stay out from the crowd and the partnership with SecurionPay neatly ties back to our vision of delivering a seamless user experience,” says Director of XTB International Michal Sobczyk. “We see SecurionPay as our strategic partner because of their technology that answer all our needs. As the leading brokerage house, we wanted to put in place innovative solutions and service excellence. SecurionPay has it all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under this agreement, SecurionPay with its unrivaled experience on the high-risk market will be delivering conversion-increasing payment solutions. The partnership combines the strengths of both companies to meet an ever-increasing demand for secure financial operations in this industry. As a result, a forex company can deliver uninterrupted payments to their customers and monitor each transaction in real time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re thrilled to formalize our partnership with XTB, sharing advanced technologies and complementary competencies. The integration of our systems enables our new partner to create a unique experience for all XTB clients. They will see a real difference,” says SecurionPay CEO Lucas Jankowiak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SecurionPay’s solution gives forex companies full control over the development process and their transactions. They can see all the payment details in real time, so they can react immediately if something unexpected occurs. All this with the most advanced security systems. The payment platform makes it easy to expand activities to other markets by allowing businesses to conduct operations in 160 currencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">X-Trade Brokers was also looking for a solution that adopts the security mindset. SecurionPay, with its potential to revolutionize the payments market, offers anti-fraud tools, non-invasive 3D Secure, built-in machine learning capabilities to detect fraud, and fraud patterns that mark charges as fraudulent or suspicious as soon as they are made. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We understand that there’s a huge number of transactions in (the) forex industry, so while meeting all PCI level 1 standards, we offer a technologically advanced solution that helps to minimize card fraud,” explains Jankowiak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The foreign exchange market is the largest and fast-growing sector with payment operations across borders. The value of transactions processed each day all over the globe is rising exponentially so the entire process needs to be as simple and secure as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By choosing SecurionPay, we could avoid mounds of paperwork to get started, so the onboarding process was at the speed we needed. Its breakthrough technology that truly mirrors the world in which we operate enables us to connect with customers faster. Since the partnership went live in July this year, we can see an impressive difference in credit and debit card acceptance,” says Sobczyk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SecurionPay enables its clients to combine various billing models and create payment scenarios that fit their needs as much as possible. A payment platform focuses mostly on the technology and user experience, so SecurionPay expands its solution to help partners hit those goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our technology allows XTB and other clients to process an infinite number of transactions. There are no delays, redirections or interruptions in payments, and everything can be done smoothly in seconds. We are expanding the solution with many features to give clients new paths for revenue development and help them grow at double-digit rates,” sums up Jankowiak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The collaboration is a step forward for both SecurionPay and XTB in the midst of companies aiming to bring continuous innovation to deliver the best-in-class trading experience and establish long-term relationships with clients.</span></p>

                <title>Democratization of Advanced Technologies: Building AI That Can Build AI</title>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, who invest millions in attracting and retaining scarce talent, are looking for automated ways to deal with a shortage of AI experts. In that search, they are developing intelligent machines that can replicate themselves to perform tasks of varying complexity. This out-of-the-box approach to the shortage of talent is a positive step for millions of businesses around the world that will benefit from the democratization of advanced technologies.</p>

<h2 id="tech-firms-turn-to-self-replicating-ai-to-make-up-for-talent-shortage">Tech firms turn to self-replicating AI to make up for talent shortage</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>About 10,000 people across the world have the education, experience, and talent needed to build complex, mathematical algorithms that are key to building AI-based technology. No more than a few thousand companies have the right talent for building AI, but many more have the necessary data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The shortage of talents is leading to concerns about the ability of smaller incumbents to make any headway into the monopoly created by big firms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Companies are investing heavily in AI technology research &amp; development that can circumvent the difficulty of building AI products that are meant to do smaller tasks (image/speech recognition tools, online chatbots).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alongside the offerings from bigger firms, boutique firms offer customizable versions of these technologies that allow small enterprises to adopt AI-powered tools.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Researchers at these firms are also working on AI systems that reduce dependence on human labor. Google’s AutoML is targeted at producing computer algorithms that are programmed to run certain tasks based on data analyses that don’t require human intervention. Google’s AutoML will put this complex technology into the hands of businesses without extensive expertise in AI. This project by Google will help companies build systems with AI even if they don’t have extensive expertise.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://techwireasia.com/2017/11/tech-firms-turn-self-replicating-ai-makeup-talent-shortage/">Read more</a> on Tech Wire Asia + the New York Times on how large tech companies are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/technology/machine-learning-artificial-intelligence-ai.html">building AI that can build AI</a> and explanation of a particular <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3236048/machine-learning/review-h2oai-automates-machine-learning.html">example with driverless AI stack by H2O.ai</a>.</p>

<p>Driverless AI really is able to create and train good ML models without requiring ML expertise from users.</p>

<p>Not only do tech corporations fund their own initiatives but they also partner with other tech companies to democratize AI/ML. While the monopoly theme will inevitably come up at some point in the future, at the moment, those initiatives define the future of business efficiency and innovation adoption opportunities across industries and businesses of a great variety of sizes.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft--aws-collaborate-on-machine-learning">Microsoft &amp; AWS Collaborate on Machine Learning</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Microsoft and AWS have collaborated to democratize deep learning and AI. Gluon is a joint effort between Microsoft Research and Amazon AI and is intended to make developing solutions using ML easier and quicker.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gluon is an open-source deep learning and neural network solution that is exposed through a Python-based API. It comes with prebuilt neural network components that can be created on the fly and used to train algorithms making it easier to define, debug, iterate and reuse components.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gluon improves computational efficiency by providing a mechanism to schedule and automatically distribute models across multiple GPUs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The specifications for Gluon have been published to allow developers and organizations using other deep learning frameworks to take advantage of it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Google is not currently part of the group supporting Gluon, so there is no timeframe for support of TensorFlow, the AI framework that Google open-sourced in 2015.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2017/08/30/hey-cortana-open-alexa-microsoft-amazons-first-kind-collaboration/">second time</a> that Amazon and Microsoft have announced a collaboration on AI. In August, they spoke on the support being built into their own digital assistants to be able to work with each other. With this collaboration, Microsoft’s Cortana can leverage the retail knowledge of Amazon’s Alexa, whilst Alexa is able to leverage the productivity features of Cortana.</p>

                    <p>Conforming to and simultaneously molding user behavior around new products &amp; services for secure mobile transactions are critical for driving adoption. Ensuring that these products and services are built and deployed in such a way that they can continuously evolve to changing user behavior is a critical component for ensuring scale.</p>

<p>Adoption and scale, which are sometimes used interchangeably, are two very different constructs. The former is dictated by usability, whereas the latter is dependent on the underlying utility – underscore utility and usability.</p>

<p>We have defined m-transactions as the ability to securely and seamlessly conduct transactions in the virtual and real world – across all channels and devices – for finance, retail, healthcare, education, and government applications. Let us stretch this definition further by essentially making the “m” silent, extending this to secure omnichannel digital transactions, and additionally throwing in transactions initiated through “things” on the Internet-of-Everything.</p>

<p>This should give us a fairly comprehensive representation of all personalized transactions and related value-added services across all channels, nodes, demographics, and markets worldwide.</p>

<p>If we were to design a scalable architecture to achieve this – for technology, business, and regulation – we would first start with the components that are truly agnostic to the devices, channels, and services, and are fundamentally focused on enabling true aggregation of disparate domains for existing as well as potentially new transaction rails. We would then layer the vertical requirements, followed by the channel and nodal requirements, and finally top-off our tiered architecture with the personalization layer. There would still be enough flexibility left to introduce an additional layer for customizations specific to demographics and markets.</p>

<p>While this five-tiered architecture is clearly an oversimplification, the purpose of this exercise is not to define the components of the individual layers but to rather figure out exactly where we need to draw a distinction between utility vis-à-vis usability. Once again, it is the usability that will drive adoption and the utility that will ensure scale. Hence, if we are truly trying to understand the issues that will drive adoption and the factors that will influence scale, we will be better served drawing this very important line as early as possible.</p>

<p>As many large infrastructure deployments over the history of human endeavor have shown us, the utility needs to be in place first before the usability can start to show results. Similarly, with our expanded definition of m-transactions, we will need a utility that can ensure scale, upon which we can then start to build the usability to drive adoption.</p>

<p>In the world of financial services, FinServ is slowly but surely becoming the underlying utility, whereas FinTech is being heralded as the driver of usability. While there will be exceptions, this is not necessarily a bad thing and may be a good indicator of things to come across other verticals beyond the world of finance. It is safe to state that the next decade will be about the progression of FinTech to FinServ, from the periphery to the core, from disruption to legacy, from usability to utility, and from adoption to scale.</p>

                    <p>The world is getting smarter and the consumers are becoming increasingly impatient, especially in today’s digital age. With technology innovations happening every day, customers are looking for services which require less time and minimal effort on their part. In this technologically advanced era where users can perform and manage their daily tasks with just a few clicks, visiting branch offices for opening a bank account seems unnecessary.</p>

<p>With the ever-tightening regulations and increasing concerns over AML/CFT, banks are now more cautious than ever in their KYC processes. Traditionally, this process involved physical ID/Document verification in which the applicant had to personally visit a branch office and present the relevant documents so that a bank representative can verify the applicant’s authenticity. This practice was not only expensive and time-consuming but also hampered customer experience as they as had to wait for days before getting approved for a new account.</p>

<p>But the KYC process has finally moved to the next stage where customers no longer have to attend face-to-face meetings or visit a branch for authenticating their documents. Financial institutions can make use of various web-based and mobile-based applications to verify an applicant’s identity.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-digital-iddocument-verification-process-is-carried-out">How the digital ID/document verification process is carried out</h2>

<p>Electronic identity verification (eIDV) enables banks and financial institutions to remotely verify a person’s identity through digital means. Unlike the age-old method of physical verification, which required the physical presence of both the applicant and documents like passport, license, utility bills, etc., eIDV checks various consumer data points such as name, date of birth, address, etc. The data is checked against a pool of databases such as government agencies, credit bureaus, telephone/utility records, public data, watch lists, cyber-data, etc., in order to verify an applicant’s legitimacy.</p>

<p>With the increasing demand of eIDV, the market has witnessed various technological breakthroughs applied in this space such as biometric-based verification, machine learning, blockchain, video-based and behavior-based verification.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/ID.png" alt="ID.png" /></p>

<p>At LTP we have always had a keen interest in exploring the developments in the eIDV space. As a part of our recent <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/research-categories/digital-id-verification-competitive-analysis-of-key-players">study</a>, we took a deep dive into the nuances of digital ID verification, covering the various aspects and depth with which ID verification is conducted by companies.</p>

<p>As part of our research, we analyzed the offerings of some of the most exciting players in this space and evaluated their solutions based on our proprietary evaluation framework.</p>

<p>The objective of this <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/research-categories/digital-id-verification-competitive-analysis-of-key-players">study</a> was to understand the best player in the digital ID verification space, with a special focus on the depth with which they conduct the verification processes.</p>

<h2 id="medici-research-evaluation-parameters-and-the-evaluation-framework">MEDICI research evaluation parameters and the evaluation framework</h2>

<p>Some of the important evaluation parameters for analyzing the players in this space include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Number of partnerships across geographies for ID/doc verification: It refers to the number of partnerships that are formed by the service providers for conducting ID and document verification processes. It signifies the global coverage of these companies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Degree of customizable solution: The criterion refers to what extent a user can customize the verification rule set as per their business needs. It enables the users to choose the type of method and the data source that they require to conduct ID verifications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Single interface flexibility: It indicates the ease with which customers can integrate the platform with their core business systems as all the services are provided through a unified platform.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Verification depth of data based on third-party database: Data quality is one of the most important aspects for successfully verifying a customer’s identity. Types of common data include credit bureaus, property records, government records, watch lists, etc. These parameters basically signify the depth with which ID verification is conducted by these companies.</p>

                <title>The Bright Future of AI: Favored by CIOs Over Blockchain, as It Shows Positive ROI in Real-World Applications [Curated Content]</title>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revolutionary technology is rarely spoken of in terms of real-world returns. Rather, it is heralded for the opportunities/possibilities it opens for businesses that can perfect it in business cases and leverage for higher returns. One of those technologies – AI – is finally showing some ROI (not the first time, but nonetheless). Denmark's largest bank sees returns as it tears apart the playbook and brings machines into operations.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denmark's largest bank is using AI and machine learning to ‘tear everything apart’ – and it’s starting to pay off</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danske Bank, the largest bank in Denmark, lead the way in 2013 by introducing a new and convenient way to transfer money called MobilePay. Today, MobilePay is the Nordic region's leading money transfer app with 3.8 million users in its core market, Denmark.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Danske Bank is applying the same approach as with MobilePay – but instead of payments, it focuses on customer behavior and analytics. The bank has created an in-house startup called Advanced Analytics, whose sole purpose is to shake things up with bleeding-edge AI and machine learning technology.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Based on online behavior we identified customers in a specific situation where financial advice is needed – for instance, when a person changes jobs with a new salary and pension plan."</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danske Bank used these situations to contact customers proactively and achieved 62% better results than in their traditional campaigns. Danske Bank also wants to empower customers on their own terms – by using peer-based models á la TripAdvisor.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We introduced a concept called 'Others Like You,' which enables us to show a customer the choice of people with a similar profile, [for instance when choosing] pension plans,” says Bjørn Büchmann-Slorup, Head of Advanced Analytics at Danske Bank.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://nordic.businessinsider.com/denmarks-largest-bank-is-using-machine-learning-to-predict-the-customers-behavior--and-they-like-it-2017-11"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> BI.</span></p>
<hr />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent survey of CIOs found that CIOs downvote blockchain in favor of AI – not really surprisingly. Does that mean AI is much closer to finding a widespread business application with positive ROI than the much-hyped blockchain?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">CIOs prefer AI over blockchain for banking and investment services: Report</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence (AI) overpowers blockchain and emerges as the most preferred option for bank honchos as far as investments are concerned, said a report by Gartner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CIOs in the banking and investment services have started believing that the old practices and models are not going to sustain in future. “Digital transformation and its related technologies such as APIs are more important for banking than for other industries,” said Pete Redshaw, Managing Vice President at Gartner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey revealed that digital transformation is of high priority and matter the most for the respondents in the banking domain. About 26% of respondents from the banking sector marked digitization as a matter of first priority in comparison to 17% respondents from other industries.</span></p>

<hr />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another interesting piece for today explores how AI evolves, suggesting that "within not so many years, we'll have an AI that incrementally learns to become as smart as a little animal – curiously, creatively, and continually learning to plan, reason, and decompose a wide variety of problems into quickly solvable (or already solved) sub-problems. Soon after we develop monkey-level AI, we may have human-level AI with truly limitless applications."</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falling Walls: The Past, Present &amp; Future of Artificial Intelligence</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A particular focus of mine since the year 1990 has been on unsupervised AIs that exhibit what I have called "artificial curiosity" and creativity. They invent their own goals and experiments to figure out how the world works, and what can be done in it. Such AIs may use LSTM as a sub-module that learns to predict consequences of actions. They do not slavishly imitate human teachers, but derive rewards from continually creating and solving their own, new, previously unsolvable problems – a bit like playing kids, to become more and more general problem-solvers in the process (buzzword: PowerPlay, 2011). We have already built simple "artificial scientists" based on this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extrapolating from this work, I think that within not so many years, we'll have an AI that incrementally learns to become as smart as a little animal – curiously, creatively, and continually learning to plan, reason, and decompose a wide variety of problems into quickly solvable (or already solved) sub-problems. Soon after we develop monkey-level AI, we may have human-level AI, with truly limitless applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it won't stop there. Many curious AIs that invent their own goals will quickly improve themselves, restricted only by the fundamental limits of computability and physics. What will they do? Space is hostile to humans but friendly to appropriately designed robots and offers many more resources than our thin film of a biosphere, which receives less than a billionth of the sun's light. While some AIs will remain fascinated with life – at least as long as they don't fully understand it – most will be more interested in the incredible new opportunities for robots and software out there in space.

                <title>The Bright Future of AI: Favored by CIOs Over Blockchain, as It Shows Positive ROI in Real-World Applications</title>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Revolutionary technology is rarely spoken of in terms of real-world returns. Rather, it is heralded for the opportunities/possibilities it opens for businesses that can perfect it in business cases and leverage for higher returns. One of those technologies – AI – is finally showing some ROI (not the first time, but nonetheless). Denmark’s largest bank sees returns as it tears apart the playbook and brings machines into operations.</p>

<h2 id="denmarks-largest-bank-is-using-ai-and-machine-learning-to-tear-everything-apart--and-its-starting-to-pay-off">Denmark’s largest bank is using AI and machine learning to ‘tear everything apart’ – and it’s starting to pay off</h2>

<p>Danske Bank, the largest bank in Denmark, lead the way in 2013 by introducing a new and convenient way to transfer money called MobilePay. Today, MobilePay is the Nordic region’s leading money transfer app with 3.8 million users in its core market, Denmark.\</p>

<p>Now, Danske Bank is applying the same approach as with MobilePay – but instead of payments, it focuses on customer behavior and analytics. The bank has created an in-house startup called Advanced Analytics, whose sole purpose is to shake things up with bleeding-edge AI and machine learning technology.</p>

<p>“Based on online behavior we identified customers in a specific situation where financial advice is needed – for instance, when a person changes jobs with a new salary and pension plan.”</p>

<p>Danske Bank used these situations to contact customers proactively and achieved 62% better results than in their traditional campaigns. Danske Bank also wants to empower customers on their own terms – by using peer-based models á la TripAdvisor.</p>

<p>“We introduced a concept called ‘Others Like You,’ which enables us to show a customer the choice of people with a similar profile, [for instance when choosing] pension plans,” says Bjørn Büchmann-Slorup, Head of Advanced Analytics at Danske Bank.</p>

<p>A recent survey of CIOs found that CIOs downvote blockchain in favor of AI – not really surprisingly. Does that mean AI is much closer to finding a widespread business application with positive ROI than the much-hyped blockchain?</p>

<h2 id="cios-prefer-ai-over-blockchain-for-banking-and-investment-services-report">CIOs prefer AI over blockchain for banking and investment services: Report</h2>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) overpowers blockchain and emerges as the most preferred option for bank honchos as far as investments are concerned, said a report by Gartner.</p>

<p>CIOs in the banking and investment services have started believing that the old practices and models are not going to sustain in future. “Digital transformation and its related technologies such as APIs are more important for banking than for other industries,” said Pete Redshaw, Managing Vice President at Gartner.</p>

<p>The survey revealed that digital transformation is of high priority and matter the most for the respondents in the banking domain. About 26% of respondents from the banking sector marked digitization as a matter of first priority in comparison to 17% respondents from other industries.</p>

<p>Another interesting piece for today explores how AI evolves, suggesting that “within not so many years, we’ll have an AI that incrementally learns to become as smart as a little animal – curiously, creatively, and continually learning to plan, reason, and decompose a wide variety of problems into quickly solvable (or already solved) sub-problems. Soon after we develop monkey-level AI, we may have human-level AI with truly limitless applications.”</p>

<h2 id="falling-walls-the-past-present--future-of-artificial-intelligence">Falling Walls: The Past, Present &amp; Future of Artificial Intelligence</h2>

<p>A particular focus of mine since the year 1990 has been on unsupervised AIs that exhibit what I have called “artificial curiosity” and creativity. They invent their own goals and experiments to figure out how the world works, and what can be done in it. Such AIs may use LSTM as a sub-module that learns to predict consequences of actions. They do not slavishly imitate human teachers, but derive rewards from continually creating and solving their own, new, previously unsolvable problems – a bit like playing kids, to become more and more general problem-solvers in the process (buzzword: PowerPlay, 2011). We have already built simple “artificial scientists” based on this.</p>

<p>Extrapolating from this work, I think that within not so many years, we’ll have an AI that incrementally learns to become as smart as a little animal – curiously, creatively, and continually learning to plan, reason, and decompose a wide variety of problems into quickly solvable (or already solved) sub-problems. Soon after we develop monkey-level AI, we may have human-level AI, with truly limitless applications.</p>

<p>And it won’t stop there. Many curious AIs that invent their own goals will quickly improve themselves, restricted only by the fundamental limits of computability and physics. What will they do? Space is hostile to humans but friendly to appropriately designed robots and offers many more resources than our thin film of a biosphere, which receives less than a billionth of the sun’s light. While some AIs will remain fascinated with life – at least as long as they don’t fully understand it – most will be more interested in the incredible new opportunities for robots and software out there in space. Through innumerable self-replicating robot factories in the asteroid belt and beyond, they will transform the solar system, and then within a few hundred thousand years, the entire galaxy; and within billions of years, the rest of the reachable universe, held back only by the light-speed limit. (AIs or parts thereof are likely to travel by radio from transmitters to receivers – although putting these in place will take considerable time.)</p>

                <title>The Only Thing That Will Matter for Robo-Advisors</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/2017/11/02/the-only-thing-that-will-matter-for-robo-advisors/</link>
                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>The term ‘robo-advisor’ refers to online investment services that deliver algorithmically derived financial advice. Robo-advisors typically provide their clients with one or more of the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Formulaic goal-based advice,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tax-smart software,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Globally diversified asset allocation, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Index exchange-traded fund (ETF) portfolio construction.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The commoditization of these features has made it nearly impossible for robo-advisors to differentiate themselves from their competitors.</p>

<p>Predictably, robo-advisors have begun a race to zero, as lower fees are the only differentiator readily understood by the majority of clients. The winners of this race will be the ‘Big Four’ major fund companies – Vanguard, Charles Schwab, Blackrock, and Fidelity. Their scale, brand recognition, and ownership of funds will allow them to waive management fees, cross-sell services, and reduce fund fees.</p>

<p>To compete with the ‘Big Four,’ pure-play robo-advisors will need to transition from mechanical goal-based advice to holistic personalized financial planning, and more importantly, shift from index ETFs to proprietary investment solutions.</p>

<p>The evolutionary path for the second generation of pure-play robo-advisors (further referred to as robo-advisors) will require the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) as well as a renewed focus on asset management. Robo-advisors’ incorporation of machine learning will allow them to develop holistic and client specific financial plans in a cost-efficient manner.</p>

<p>In general, pure-play robo-advisors have a technological advantage over the ‘Big Four’ and will likely be the first to bring comprehensive AI to the FinTech space. API integration coupled with AI has the unparalleled ability to aggregate and analyze a client’s digital profile. This aggregation will include real-time data from the client’s banking, brokerage, lifestyle, and work-related digital platforms. The benefit of this aggregation is that it forces AI to continuously analyze documented long-term behavior. Analysis of observed behavior can lead to predictive insights into the client’s upcoming life events, volatility tolerance, cash needs, spending habits, and life expectancy. The end-result of this analysis will be a dynamic financial plan and personalized, behaviorally derived advice.</p>

<p>Despite the head start in AI technology currently enjoyed by robo-advisors, the software will ultimately become a commodity. The true long-term differentiator for robo-advisors lies not within their technology capabilities, but rather their investment solutions.</p>

<p>Although robo-advisors need to continue to enhance their technology, it is imperative that they offer proprietary investment solutions that are superior to those of the ‘Big Four.’ Asset allocation among the Big Four’s ETFs, even if done well, will likely not lead to substantial differences in performance due to similar allocation methods and fee structures.</p>

<p>To overcome this dilemma, robo-advisors will need to design proprietary investment products. Furthermore, these products will, on average, need to outperform their benchmark. Two robo-advisors that have historically outperformed are <a href="http://www.polarisportfolios.com/">Polaris Portfolios</a> and <a href="https://www.qplum.co/">QPlum</a>.</p>

<p>The survival and growth of robo-advisors is directly dependent on their ability to cost-effectively produce quality investment vehicles. The vertical integration of differentiated investment products will give robo-advisors the ability to keep and gain market share in the FinTech space.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the success of automated investment services – particularly when it comes to pure-play robo-advisors – will not be determined by the implementation of the AI technology, but by the only thing that should matter in wealth management: long-term performance. Such performance will require a commitment to the development of proprietary, alpha-generating products. Let the race begin!</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>As of July 2017, WhatsApp counted 1.3 billion active monthly users. To put things into perspective, imagine that the whole population of India or China is active on WhatsApp every month. WhatsApp is a well-known heavyweight in mobile communications, and now, the Facebook-owned social app is armed and ready to storm one of the most important FinTech markets in the world – India. All local players (possibly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/31/remitly-is-raising-up-to-115m-led-by-naspers-payu-to-double-down-on-remittances-in-india/">Remitly</a>, PayU, <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/how-phonepe-plans-to-beat-paytm-in-the-payments-game-with-this-pos-calculator-2424735.html">PhonePe</a>, Paytm) are entering a whole new level of competition with this announcement. Fascinating times ahead!</p>

<h2 id="whatsapp-in-chat-payments-feature-is-bad-news-for-digital-wallets-payment-companies-in-india">WhatsApp in-chat payments feature is bad news for digital wallets, payment companies in India</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Instant messenger WhatsApp is readying an intuitive in-chat payments feature, ahead of a likely December launch in India, that promises to make customer onboarding a cinch. It could be the biggest threat that players in the Indian digital payments ecosystem have faced to date.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will be the first time that WhatsApp is introducing the payments feature anywhere in the world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>WhatsApp partnered with the State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, and HDFC Bank – three of India’s biggest banks – to launch the feature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The uniqueness of the WhatsApp payments feature is that a user can make payments without leaving the chat interface just like sharing a contact or location on the instant messenger.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>WhatsApp’s entry into the space threatens digital wallet companies as the instant messenger counts over 200 million users in India, the largest user base it has in the world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consulting firm Zinnov estimates that nearly 2 million women sell products using WhatsApp and Facebook, totaling sales of $8-9 billion. This is projected to grow to $48-60 billion by 2022.</p>

<p>Orange moving into banking intensifies the competition in the already-very-competitive banking and tech space. Moreover, telcos are the ones to impose the most interesting challenge as they hold the keys to connectivity. Telcos have always played an extremely important, highly integrated role in users’ lives – everything is tied to a telco, making communication companies critical stakeholders in anything that has to do with providing online/mobile services. Will Orange redefine the landscape and invite other telcos to join the competition?</p>

<h2 id="exclusive--orange-is-the-new-bank-telecom-giant-ventures-into-lending">Exclusive – Orange is the new bank? Telecom giant ventures into lending</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Telecom giant Orange launches its own bank on Thursday, aiming to win 25% of France’s online banking market by capitalizing on the rising use of smartphones to steal shares from established lenders with inferior technology.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The launch has two goals: 1. Push to find alternative revenue streams and retain clients in the face of a price war in the telecommunications sector; 2. Test for the telecoms and banking industry, marking the first attempt in a major developed market by a telecoms company to launch a standalone bank.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About 25,000 customers have expressed interest ahead of the launch. The company has 21 million mobile clients.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Orange has beefed up financial services across its networks over the past 10 years under several brands, such as Orange Money, Orange Cash, and Orange Finanse in Poland, which uses a platform created by Polish lender mBank.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Orange targets 400 million euros in revenues for its financial services unit by 2018, out of which half would come from Africa.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Our ambition is to offer everything. We are a complete bank,” said Andre Coisne, Chief Executive of Orange Bank.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From November 2, Orange customers can use an instant mobile payment service as well as a free debit card, current account and savings account. Its online app will also allow users to transfer money via text message to another Orange account, and use Apple or Android wallets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other products, such as loans and insurance, are expected next year.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As a tribute to what <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/?s=amazon">we at LTP have been talking about for some time</a>, FIs have started realizing that <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/understand-future-of-financial-services-industry/">FinTechs are not that big of a challenge</a> to their top line and bottom line, but <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/epic-lesson-banks-can-learn-from-amazon/">Amazon</a> may very well be.</p>

<h2 id="banks-need-to-fear-amazons-finance-ambitions-mckinsey-says">Banks Need to Fear Amazon’s Finance Ambitions, McKinsey Says</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The industry needs to continue its digital makeover to protect the up to 40% of revenues at risk by 2025 and prepare for competition from so-called platform companies like Bezos’ Amazon.com, Inc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“We thought that FinTechs would provide the chief digital threat,” authors of the report said. Instead, it’s become clear that e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. “are reshaping one industry after another, blurring sector boundaries as they seek to be all things to all people.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amazon has a small-business lending arm that has doled out more than <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-08/amazon-s-lending-business-for-online-merchants-gains-momentum">$3 billion</a> to more than 20,000 of the merchants on its e-commerce platform.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Banks need to defend their turf. Payments will become the battleground where finance will be fought over the next 15 years.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tech companies will reorder global commerce into ecosystems in which giants provide a variety of products and services through a single gateway.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Banks will still have opportunities in this new order because they are trusted by customers and hold vast data sets about retail and corporate transactions. The global banking industry could offset the loss of profits from price competition by partnering with platform companies and generating more revenue from their data. Banks that go further by creating their own platforms could elevate their ROE.</p>
  </li>

                <link>http://localhost:4000/insights/robo-advisors/2017/11/02/only-thing-that-will-matter-for-robo-advisors/</link>
                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term ‘robo-advisor’ refers to online investment services that deliver algorithmically derived financial advice. Robo-advisors typically provide their clients with one or more of the following features: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Formulaic goal-based advice, </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Tax-smart software, </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Globally diversified asset allocation, and </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Index exchange-traded fund (ETF) portfolio construction. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commoditization of these features has made it nearly impossible for robo-advisors to differentiate themselves from their competitors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Predictably, robo-advisors have begun a race to zero, as lower fees are the only differentiator readily understood by the majority of clients. The winners of this race will be the ‘Big Four’ major fund companies – Vanguard, Charles Schwab, Blackrock, and Fidelity. Their scale, brand recognition, and ownership of funds will allow them to waive management fees, cross-sell services, and reduce fund fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To compete with the ‘Big Four,’ pure-play robo-advisors will need to transition from mechanical goal-based advice to holistic personalized financial planning, and more importantly, shift from index ETFs to proprietary investment solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The evolutionary path for the second generation of pure-play robo-advisors (further referred to as robo-advisors) will require the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) as well as a renewed focus on asset management. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">R</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obo-advisors’ incorporation of machine learning will allow them to develop holistic and client specific financial plans in a cost-efficient manner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, pure-play robo-advisors have a technological advantage over the ‘Big Four’ and will likely be the first to bring comprehensive AI to the FinTech space. API integration coupled with AI has the unparalleled ability to aggregate and analyze a client’s digital profile. This aggregation will include real-time data from the client’s banking, brokerage, lifestyle, and work-related digital platforms. The benefit of this aggregation is that it forces AI to continuously analyze documented long-term behavior. Analysis of observed behavior can lead to predictive insights into the client’s upcoming life events, volatility tolerance, cash needs, spending habits, and life expectancy. The end-result of this analysis will be a dynamic financial plan and personalized, behaviorally derived advice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the head start in AI technology currently enjoyed by robo-advisors, the software will ultimately become a commodity. The true long-term differentiator for robo-advisors lies not within their technology capabilities, but rather their investment solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although robo-advisors need to continue to enhance their technology, it is imperative that they offer proprietary investment solutions that are superior to those of the ‘Big Four.’ Asset allocation among the Big Four’s ETFs, even if done well, will likely not lead to substantial differences in performance due to similar allocation methods and fee structures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To overcome this dilemma, robo-advisors will need to design proprietary investment products. Furthermore, these products will, on average, need to outperform their benchmark. Two robo-advisors that have historically outperformed are</span><a href="http://www.polarisportfolios.com"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Polaris Portfolios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.qplum.co/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">QPlum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survival and growth of robo-advisors is directly dependent on their ability to cost-effectively produce quality investment vehicles. The vertical integration of differentiated investment products will give robo-advisors the ability to keep and gain market share in the FinTech space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the success of automated investment services – particularly when it comes to pure-play robo-advisors – will not be determined by the implementation of the AI technology, but by the only thing that should matter in wealth management: long-term performance. Such performance will require a commitment to the development of proprietary, alpha-generating products. Let the race begin!</span></p>

                <title>Daily Review: FinTech is Not a Threat to Banks. Telcos, WhatsApps, &amp; Amazons of the World Are</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/banking/fintech/insights/2017/11/02/fintech-not-threat-to-banks-telcos-whatsapps-and-amazons-of-the-world-are/</link>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of July 2017, WhatsApp counted 1.3 billion active monthly users. To put things into perspective, imagine that the whole population of India or China is active on WhatsApp every month. WhatsApp is a well-known heavyweight in mobile communications, and now, the Facebook-owned social app is armed and ready to storm one of the most important FinTech markets in the world – India. All local players (possibly </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/31/remitly-is-raising-up-to-115m-led-by-naspers-payu-to-double-down-on-remittances-in-india/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remitly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, PayU, </span><a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/how-phonepe-plans-to-beat-paytm-in-the-payments-game-with-this-pos-calculator-2424735.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PhonePe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Paytm) are entering a whole new level of competition with this announcement. Fascinating times ahead!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">WhatsApp in-chat payments feature is bad news for digital wallets, payment companies in India</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Instant messenger WhatsApp is readying an intuitive in-chat payments feature, ahead of a likely December launch in India, that promises to make customer onboarding a cinch. It could be the biggest threat that players in the Indian digital payments ecosystem have faced to date.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">This will be the first time that WhatsApp is introducing the payments feature anywhere in the world.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">WhatsApp partnered with the State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, and HDFC Bank – three of India’s biggest banks – to launch the feature. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The uniqueness of the WhatsApp payments feature is that a user can make payments without leaving the chat interface just like sharing a contact or location on the instant messenger.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">WhatsApp’s entry into the space threatens digital wallet companies as the instant messenger counts over 200 million users in India, the largest user base it has in the world.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Consulting firm Zinnov estimates that nearly 2 million women sell products using WhatsApp and Facebook, totaling sales of $8-9 billion. This is projected to grow to $48-60 billion by 2022.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange moving into banking intensifies the competition in the already-very-competitive banking and tech space. Moreover, telcos are the ones to impose the most interesting challenge as they hold the keys to connectivity. Telcos have always played an extremely important, highly integrated role in users' lives – everything is tied to a telco, making communication companies critical stakeholders in anything that has to do with providing online/mobile services. Will Orange redefine the landscape and invite other telcos to join the competition? </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exclusive – Orange is the new bank? Telecom giant ventures into lending</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Telecom giant Orange launches its own bank on Thursday, aiming to win 25% of France’s online banking market by capitalizing on the rising use of smartphones to steal shares from established lenders with inferior technology.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The launch has two goals: 1. Push to find alternative revenue streams and retain clients in the face of a price war in the telecommunications sector; 2. Test for the telecoms and banking industry, marking the first attempt in a major developed market by a telecoms company to launch a standalone bank.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">About 25,000 customers have expressed interest ahead of the launch. The company has 21 million mobile clients.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Orange has beefed up financial services across its networks over the past 10 years under several brands, such as Orange Money, Orange Cash, and Orange Finanse in Poland, which uses a platform created by Polish lender mBank.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Orange targets 400 million euros in revenues for its financial services unit by 2018, out of which half would come from Africa.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“Our ambition is to offer everything. We are a complete bank,” said Andre Coisne, Chief Executive of Orange Bank.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">From November 2, Orange customers can use an instant mobile payment service as well as a free debit card, current account and savings account. Its online app will also allow users to transfer money via text message to another Orange account, and use Apple or Android wallets.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Other products, such as loans and insurance, are expected next year. </span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a tribute to what </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/?s=amazon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we at LTP have been talking about for some time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, FIs have started realizing that </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/understand-future-of-financial-services-industry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTechs are not that big of a challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to their top line and bottom line, but </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/epic-lesson-banks-can-learn-from-amazon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may very well be.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks Need to Fear Amazon’s Finance Ambitions, McKinsey Says</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The industry needs to continue its digital makeover to protect the up to 40% of revenues at risk by 2025 and prepare for competition from so-called platform companies like Bezos’ Amazon.com, Inc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“We thought that FinTechs would provide the chief digital threat,” authors of the report said. Instead, it’s become clear that e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. “are reshaping one industry after another, blurring sector boundaries as they seek to be all things to all people.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon has a small-business lending arm that has doled out more than </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-08/amazon-s-lending-business-for-online-merchants-gains-momentum"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to more than 20,000 of the merchants on its e-commerce platform.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Banks need to defend their turf. Payments will become the battleground where finance will be fought over the next 15 years.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Tech companies will reorder global commerce into ecosystems in which giants provide a variety of products and services through a single gateway. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Banks will still have opportunities in this new order because they are trusted by customers and hold vast data sets about retail and corporate transactions. The global banking industry could offset the loss of profits from price competition by partnering with platform companies and generating more revenue from their data. Banks that go further by creating their own platforms could elevate their ROE. </span></li>

                <title>Running Scared – Why the Bank of the Future Is Not a Bank</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/banking/fintech/insights/2017/11/01/why-the-bank-of-the-future-is-not-a-bank/</link>
                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 10 years from now, are we going to look back and realize that banks had already missed the massive market change and were already on their way out?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, I have been having a number of conversations with friends and clients (all experts) about digital transformation and banks built for the future. On more than a few occasions, we’ve stared down the rabbit hole of tactical topics like building the best product development shop, becoming a better acquisition target or attracting millennial depositors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In every case, they had lost the narrative about banking and I’ve had to reset the conversation. We had to get back to the first principles – a topic worthy of its own discussion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In resetting these conversations, the following four posits are good starting points I’ve used:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posit 1: Banking Products Not From Banks</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A variety of people have written at length about the rise and success of organizations like </span><a href="https://rocket.quickenloans.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rocket Mortgage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.sofi.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoFi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and others. Many banks partner with FinTechs for ancillary products and services in lieu of being able to build and deploy them internally. This limits growth and introduces a variety of alternative competitors not burdened by traditional banking mores and norms. It is now significantly more likely that we get banking products from non-banks.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posit 2: Bank’s Changing Customer Landscape</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone are the days of &lt;20 transactions per month oriented around the branch. I had 209 transactions in September and not a single one involved a check or a branch. The last time I went into a branch was to close an account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve gone from mobile-first to mobile-only in a remarkably short amount of time. That trend is expanding and extending across the financial services landscape.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posit 3: Dissatisfaction Drift</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you look at the wave of dissatisfactions roiling around the world, a massive one comes out of banking. While the 2008 financial crisis might seem far away to those in the industry, it had a massive – and lasting – impact on the average person. Not since the great depression, I think, do people speak of banks in as negative a way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also consider drops in mortgages, the glut in car loans, and the dominant role consumer payments have begun to play via touchless payment platforms and peer-to-peer payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add to that a massive increase in competition in traditional FinServ markets, like financial advisors vis-a-vis robo-advisors, with price wars and subsequent drops in customer satisfaction. In the political spectrum, these waves brought Chavez, Duterte, Trump, and Sanders to the forefront; in the banking space, it has opened a massive wedge for organizations like </span><a href="https://squareup.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Square</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (and their new charter) and others to ride the wave.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posit 4: The Wildcards of AI &amp; Blockchain</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having spent over 25 years in and around AI, I know it will not cure all the world's ills; and it certainly will not be a panacea to solve banking challenges for anyone – be they a banker, a consumer, a regulator or a banking solution provider. AI is just one category of algorithms that can be wielded – sometimes well, oftentimes not well – as part of large problems being solved.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/an-overview-of-blockchain-technology/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is evolving in much the same way enterprise data storage has evolved – except, in this case, we are not going to witness a 20-year evolution, but a 5-year one. At the end of it, we will be able to store and share information just a bit more securely than we do today. Blockchain is the realization that information alone, without context &amp; isolated, has almost no value. Blockchain will fulfill the dreams, desires, and promises of all of those who promised that databases will solve your problem in the ‘80s and ‘90s, how the cloud would solve all your problems in the 2000s, and how Big Data would solve all the woes of the last decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both cases, try to ignore the hype machine.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get Back to First Principles</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grab a cup of coffee, turn off your phone, and write these four posits down on a piece of paper (yes, paper). Now, just think about the future for an hour. Get back to first principles:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">If you’re a bank, focus on running the best bank at the lowest expense with the highest customer satisfaction you can. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">If you are a consumer, understand all your options, do some research, and pick &amp; choose your solutions thoughtfully. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">If you’re a banking solutions provider, maybe get an espresso and figure out how to survive the next 10 years intact.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what I’ve been thinking about: I was having a conversation with a friend (formerly of a big bank) and we were discussing common themes amongst a certain category of banks – how their financials just looked bleak: not enough deposits, costs were too high, and new products were hard </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expensive. We broke down the common solution banks use to solve these problems – consultants to renegotiate core contracts, FinTech partners sticking their head in the sand. We hypothesized the </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-modular-bank-of-the-future/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘bank of the future’</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when all core services would be outsourced – from the core bank, to all banking products, to regulatory compliance. A core business operation and marketing/sales organization would be the only non-outsourced functions. We concluded that in 10 years, this kind of completely outsourced bank </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will be</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‘best in the class bank.’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I shuddered imaging being in the boardroom of any competing bank then, or now. </span></p>

                <title>Running Scared – Why the Bank of the Future Is Not a Bank</title>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>About 10 years from now, are we going to look back and realize that banks had already missed the massive market change and were already on their way out?</p>

<p>Recently, I have been having a number of conversations with friends and clients (all experts) about digital transformation and banks built for the future. On more than a few occasions, we’ve stared down the rabbit hole of tactical topics like building the best product development shop, becoming a better acquisition target or attracting millennial depositors.</p>

<p>In every case, they had lost the narrative about banking and I’ve had to reset the conversation. We had to get back to the first principles – a topic worthy of its own discussion.</p>

<p>In resetting these conversations, the following four posits are good starting points I’ve used:</p>

<h2 id="posit-1-banking-products-not-from-banks">Posit 1: Banking Products Not From Banks</h2>

<p>A variety of people have written at length about the rise and success of organizations like <a href="https://rocket.quickenloans.com/">Rocket Mortgage</a>, <a href="https://www.sofi.com/">SoFi</a>, and others. Many banks partner with FinTechs for ancillary products and services in lieu of being able to build and deploy them internally. This limits growth and introduces a variety of alternative competitors not burdened by traditional banking mores and norms. It is now significantly more likely that we get banking products from non-banks.</p>

<h2 id="posit-2-banks-changing-customer-landscape">Posit 2: Bank’s Changing Customer Landscape</h2>

<p>Gone are the days of &lt;20 transactions per month oriented around the branch. I had 209 transactions in September and not a single one involved a check or a branch. The last time I went into a branch was to close an account.</p>

<p>We’ve gone from mobile-first to mobile-only in a remarkably short amount of time. That trend is expanding and extending across the financial services landscape.</p>

<h2 id="posit-3-dissatisfaction-drift">Posit 3: Dissatisfaction Drift</h2>

<p>If you look at the wave of dissatisfactions roiling around the world, a massive one comes out of banking. While the 2008 financial crisis might seem far away to those in the industry, it had a massive – and lasting – impact on the average person. Not since the great depression, I think, do people speak of banks in as negative a way.</p>

<p>Also consider drops in mortgages, the glut in car loans, and the dominant role consumer payments have begun to play via touchless payment platforms and peer-to-peer payments.</p>

<p>Add to that a massive increase in competition in traditional FinServ markets, like financial advisors vis-a-vis robo-advisors, with price wars and subsequent drops in customer satisfaction. In the political spectrum, these waves brought Chavez, Duterte, Trump, and Sanders to the forefront; in the banking space, it has opened a massive wedge for organizations like <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a> (and their new charter) and others to ride the wave.</p>

<h2 id="posit-4-the-wildcards-of-ai--blockchain">Posit 4: The Wildcards of AI &amp; Blockchain</h2>

<p>Having spent over 25 years in and around AI, I know it will not cure all the world’s ills; and it certainly will not be a panacea to solve banking challenges for anyone – be they a banker, a consumer, a regulator or a banking solution provider. AI is just one category of algorithms that can be wielded – sometimes well, oftentimes not well – as part of large problems being solved.</p>

<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/an-overview-of-blockchain-technology/">Blockchain</a> is evolving in much the same way enterprise data storage has evolved – except, in this case, we are not going to witness a 20-year evolution, but a 5-year one. At the end of it, we will be able to store and share information just a bit more securely than we do today. Blockchain is the realization that information alone, without context &amp; isolated, has almost no value. Blockchain will fulfill the dreams, desires, and promises of all of those who promised that databases will solve your problem in the ’80s and ’90s, how the cloud would solve all your problems in the 2000s, and how Big Data would solve all the woes of the last decade.</p>

<p>In both cases, try to ignore the hype machine.</p>

<h2 id="get-back-to-first-principles">Get Back to First Principles</h2>

<p>Grab a cup of coffee, turn off your phone, and write these four posits down on a piece of paper (yes, paper). Now, just think about the future for an hour. Get back to first principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you’re a bank, focus on running the best bank at the lowest expense with the highest customer satisfaction you can.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are a consumer, understand all your options, do some research, and pick &amp; choose your solutions thoughtfully.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you’re a banking solutions provider, maybe get an espresso and figure out how to survive the next 10 years intact.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s what I’ve been thinking about: I was having a conversation with a friend (formerly of a big bank) and we were discussing common themes amongst a certain category of banks – how their financials just looked bleak: not enough deposits, costs were too high, and new products were hard and expensive. We broke down the common solution banks use to solve these problems – consultants to renegotiate core contracts, FinTech partners sticking their head in the sand. We hypothesized the <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-modular-bank-of-the-future/">‘bank of the future’</a> when all core services would be outsourced – from the core bank, to all banking products, to regulatory compliance. A core business operation and marketing/sales organization would be the only non-outsourced functions. We concluded that in 10 years, this kind of completely outsourced bank will be the ‘best in the class bank.’ I shuddered imaging being in the boardroom of any competing bank then, or now.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Brandwatch, in collaboration with Twitter, just released the results of a very curious <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/reports/financial-services/view/">study analyzing billions of conversations one of the most vibrant social media channels</a>. “6,000 Tweets are posted every second. That’s 6,000 views, opinions, ideas, complaints, stories, compliments. It’s live human thought. And we can use it to try and answer any question,” creators of the report note.</p>

<p>One of the most important findings out of all extensiveness of coverage is the one on financial services and conversations surrounding consumer demands, complaints, and expectations. Furthermore, we will review some of the findings of the report:</p>

<h2 id="how-technology-is-shifting-customers-relationships-with-financial-services">How technology is shifting customers’ relationships with financial services</h2>

<p>As consumers are increasing the demand for convenient, on-demand services in every industry, financial institutions must be sure they’re acclimating to expectations. In an industry once shackled by the goals of keeping company data secure and private, financial institutions now must also consider the ease and convenience of their services compared to their competitors. This trend among consumers is immediately apparent when looking at the conversations surrounding 41 of the largest financial institutions.</p>

<p>When referencing these organizations, ‘convenience’ was discussed much more frequently than mentions related to security, with only temporary bursts of conversations about security and safety occurring directly following security breaches or data hacks. The study found that when discussing financial services, consumers mention ‘convenience’ six times more often than they do ‘security.’</p>

<p>Additionally, digital banking experiences on mobile and web bank apps are more positively discussed than non-digital banking experiences.</p>

<h2 id="consumer-insights-reveal-the-effects-of-financial-service-digital-transformation">Consumer insights reveal the effects of financial service digital transformation</h2>

<p>The effect of mobile and web banking on customer sentiment is apparent when looking at social data. It’s expected that when consumers reference banking experiences of any kind, the conversations would generally be more negative. People just typically don’t mention average or pleasant banking experience on social media.</p>

<p>However, there is a stark difference between how customers discuss interacting with electronic services using mobile and web apps and the conversations they have about human interactions. The following data highlights key insights into what bank customers need and expect from banking interactions:</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/reports/financial-services/view/">Financial Services: Technology, digital transformation, and the industry’s evolution towards the customer</a></p>

<p>Nearly 60% of complaints about banks online are about non-digital experiences like bank visits and phone calls. Over three-fourths of all emotive conversation around non-digital are negative, with customers frequently complaining about negative banker interactions and extremely long wait times.</p>

<h2 id="using-social-insights-to-connect-with-the-new-customer">Using social insights to connect with the new customer</h2>

<p>An audit of the conversations highlights three levels of service-related instances when people mention financial institutions directly: when they request help, after they’ve had a bad customer service experience, and before they cancel, suspend their account, or threaten to switch providers.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/t3.png" alt="t3.png" /></p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/reports/financial-services/view/">Financial Services: Technology, digital transformation, and the industry’s evolution towards the customer</a></p>

<p>The analysis of conversations about insurance companies demonstrates a healthy customer-service relationship, with fewer than 15% of customer-service mentions any more severe than requesting help or asking questions.</p>

<p>However, banking institutions and card companies have more people reporting they had negative customer service experiences or threatening to leave. Being able to use an analysis like this to deduce the exact touchpoints where brand-customer relationships break down is integral in maintaining trust, building loyalty, and improving customer sentiment around a brand.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Man Group is an example of how AI is put to production at hedge funds. Man Group is one of the world’s largest hedge funds with $96 billion under management. Since 2014, Man has been using machine learning algorithms to make autonomous trade decisions in its <a href="https://www.ahl.com/">AHL</a> fund with very positive results.</p>

<h2 id="this-is-how-hedge-funds-use-artificial-intelligence">This is How Hedge Funds Use Artificial Intelligence</h2>

<p>“Man’s engineers set boundary parameters for their ML algorithms including exposure caps, asset classes, and trading costs. They then provide the algorithms with data and let them discover patterns and correlations that would go unnoticed to human analysts. The ML algorithms constantly compare new data with historical patterns and try to guess how changes will unfold in the future. Man is applying the model to fast trade decisions as well as educated predictions for several weeks into the future.”</p>

<p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/this-is-how-hedge-funds-use-artificial-intelligence">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>AI is the backbone of a surprising variety of businesses and seamless experiences they are able to offer – whether it’s an entertainment business or financial services. Spotify, the largest on-demand music service in the world, which counts &gt;60 million subscribers (as of July 2017), and &gt;140 million active users (as of June 2017), is as much of a curious and important use case as the Man Group.</p>

<h2 id="the-amazing-ways-spotify-uses-big-data-ai-and-machine-learning-to-drive-business-success">The Amazing Ways Spotify Uses Big Data, AI, and Machine Learning To Drive Business Success</h2>

<p>There’s no doubt that Spotify is a data-driven company; it uses data in every part of the organization to drive decisions. As the service continues to acquire data points, it’s using that information to train the algorithms and machines to listen to music and extrapolate insights that impact its business and the experience of listeners.</p>

<p>One example is the Discover Weekly feature on Spotify that reached 40 million people in its first year. Every user gets a personalized playlist every week from Spotify of music that they have not heard before on the service, but that will be something the listener is expected to enjoy – a modern-day version of a best friend creating a personalized mix tape.</p>

<p>In an effort to make its mountains of data available to musicians and their managers, Spotify just launched the Spotify for Artists app that provides mobile access to analytics – everything from which playlists are generating new fans to how many streams they are getting overall. Think Google Analytics for musicians.</p>

<p>With the acquisition of Niland, the fourth acquisition for 2017, Spotify will use the API-based product and machine learning to provide its users with better search and recommendations to help them discover music they will like.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Spotify acquired the blockchain startup Mediachain Labs to help develop solutions via a decentralized database to better connect artists and licensing agreements with the tracks on Spotify’s service.</p>

If you follow financial services in the US, Charlotte, North Carolina, is no stranger to financial services as the third-largest banking hub in the US (it’s also our global headquarters and the newly created <a href="http://www.carolinafintechhub.com/">Carolina FinTech Hub</a>).</p>

<p>That’s why we’re excited to attend the upcoming <a href="http://www.qcfintech.co/se-fintech-venture-conference">Southeast FinTech Venture Conference</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.qcfintech.co/">Queen City FinTech</a>, showcasing FinTech from the region.</p>

<p>We recently caught up with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-maclean-324ab119/">Richard Maclean</a>, Partner at <a href="https://frontiercapital.com/">Frontier Capital</a>, to learn why they are so interested in FinTech and the region.</p>

<p>Enjoy the conversation! <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/southeast-fintech-venture-conference-tickets-35536968028">If you’re in the area on November 20, join us!</a></p>

<p>Patrick Rivenbark: Tell us a little bit about yourself and Frontier Capital.</p>

<p>Richard Maclean: I am a Managing Partner &amp; Co-Founder of Frontier. We started the firm in 1999 here in Charlotte and will activate Fund V later this year. Frontier is focused on B2B software and tech-enabled services investing nationally in both the US and Canada. Investments range from $20 million to $75 million in both majority and minority positions.</p>

<p>PR: The SE FinTech Venture conference is new. What attracted you to the idea?</p>

<p>RM: Charlotte has had some major successes in technology but this area is still seen as an up and coming tech. market nationally. Any group or conference supporting the local tech scene and its companies is interesting to us.</p>

<p>We have also known Dan Roselli, Queen City FinTech, and Packard Place for a long time and really think a lot of what he is doing to help foster more investment locally and want to be supportive.</p>

<p>Charlotte’s FinTech opportunity seems to be tremendous with history and resources of our financial services. The conference seemed like a great event to continue to promote that potential.</p>

<p>PR: It seems a lot of regional and super regional collaboration is going on around the country. What are your thoughts on why this is happening?</p>

<p>RM: The world, especially in technology, is moving at a much faster pace. As businesses become more competitive, they also seem to become more collaborative and evolve quickly. Many of our CEOs talk to the CEOs of their competition on a frequent basis to keep lines of communication open.</p>

<p>I think you are also seeing a lot more collaboration with organizations outside of the “major technology centers” like Silicon Valley, NYC, and Boston. Many of these “flyover” markets for technology companies are sharing resources and best practices to try and support technology companies in their markets because these companies are such major drivers of growth and job opportunities.</p>

<p>PR: What’s Frontier’s approach to investing in FinTech?</p>

<p>RM: Our approach to FinTech or any other segment in technology starts with a B2B or B2B2C business model. We are typically looking at companies with $15 million to $20 million of revenue with the potential to scale rapidly through a combination of organic growth and select acquisitions. Frontier has been very active in HR Tech investing and we are seeing some interesting overlap in FinTech and HR Tech.</p>

<p>PR: What changes do you expect in the next year or so of growth investing?</p>

<p>RM: It will be more of the same for us. After almost 20 years of focus on growth investing in B2B technology companies, we have a well-defined process for making investment decisions and driving value in our portfolio. At this point in the business cycle, you do hear a lot of concern over the timing of the next downturn or hiccup in the financial markets. As a result, you do see a focus on higher quality assets that are providing a more mission-critical solution to their customer base.</p>

<p>PR: Frontier covers a breadth of industries, how does that help your approach to FinTech investment?</p>

<p>RM: Again, all of our companies are selling into a large enterprise or middle market company; while we do cover a breadth of industries, many of our investments are in similar subsectors or addressing common trends. This gives us a very broad view of the pain points within the B2B space on how companies buy, make decisions, and prioritize. We do think this broader view can be helpful for FinTech companies going to market with a B2B business model focused on large and mid-sized enterprises.</p>

<p>PR: What advice and guidance do you give to your portfolio companies? Is there anything specific in the financial services space?</p>

<p>RM: Building growth companies is difficult work, so focus on finding partners you have alignment and a cultural fit with. Also, remember the approach and resources that propel you to different inflection points have to be refreshed and retooled to successfully navigate the next stage of growth. Many of these decisions are around talent and how you staff, organize and lead this talent.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>“<a href="https://www.westpac.com.au/news/making-news/2017/10/stress-less-new-wearables-to-tap-and-pay/">Australia is fast becoming a less-cash society</a>,” a report by the <a href="http://www.apca.com.au/">Australian Payments Network</a> said in May, noting how ATM withdrawals fell by 22% in the past five years amid declining use of cash. “Australians are embracing the convenience of contactless technology, which is contributing to the rise in card payments.”</p>

<h2 id="westpac-launches-wearable-payment-band">Westpac launches wearable payment band</h2>

<p>In lieu of the news, Westpac <a href="https://www.westpac.com.au/news/making-news/2017/10/stress-less-new-wearables-to-tap-and-pay/">reports</a> that adoption of wearables is predicted to grow. About 37% of Australians would be wearing a smart wearable – bands and smartwatches – by 2020, up from 14%, as new products are rolled out.</p>

<p>Westpac hopes to get the wearables payment bandwagon onboard with its new contactless PayWear tap-and-go band. Westpac’s devices – which were flagged in March as the bank did a pilot testing program with employees – are waterproof and battery-free.</p>

<p>Customers need to use Westpac’s everyday banking account and its debit Mastercard with PayWear, which works with existing contactless payments terminals in stores.</p>

<p>Similar to PayWave contactless payments cards, there is no need to use a companion device like a smartphone or watch for transactions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/westpac-launches-wearable-payment-band-476415">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>The wearable is not the only move by Westpac to up the ante in payments. In partnership with the largest banks in Australia, Westpac is launching the Zelle of Australia – called Beem.</p>

<h2 id="nab-westpac-and-cba-team-up-with-new-payments-app-beem">NAB, Westpac and CBA team up with new payments app, Beem</h2>

<p>Three of Australia’s banking giants are joining forces to allow instant payments between people to small businesses via a smartphone, with plans to ultimately roll out a cross-industry “digital wallet.”</p>

<p>By the end of this year, Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank, and Westpac will launch a mobile app aimed at allowing payments such as splitting a restaurant bill or paying a tradesperson.</p>

<p>The service, known as Beem, will be free and made available to any customer (irrespective of their bank) and will function on iPhones and Android phones. The app will be the first service offered by a new digital payments joint venture that has been formed between CBA, NAB, and Westpac.</p>

<p>The app promises to process payments instantly, as opposed to the current system that can take up to three days if customers are from different banks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/nab-westpac-and-cba-team-up-with-new-payments-app-beem-20171030-gzat08.html">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, one of <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/which-are-the-top-3-hottest-fintech-hubs-worldwide/">the hottest FinTech hubs in the US, and globally</a>, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/fintech-startups-defining-new-york-fintech-industry/">New York</a>, is on the verge of its own breakthrough. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Board voted to approve a USD 570-million-dollar project to phase in a new contactless fare payment system. MTA riders will be able to use a mobile wallet or a contactless card at turnstiles starting in mid-2019, with the MetroCard to be phased out by 2023.</p>

<h2 id="mta-gets-ready-to-dump-the-metrocard">MTA gets ready to dump the MetroCard</h2>

<p>“Within 18 months, a contactless system will allow riders to wave their credit card or phone near a scanner to pay the fare at 500 turnstiles and on 600 buses, the source said. Riders will be able to use the methods in all entryways to the system by 2020, they said.</p>

<p>After that, the MTA will release its own “tap card,” so that riders can then choose between using that and their own credit card or phone.”</p>

<p>The new system will be similar to how London, Chicago, and Toronto deal with fare payment.</p>

<p>Announced in May 2017, an industry-wide image-based check clearing system is being rolled out today, speeding up the check deposit process for bank customers across the UK.</p>

<h2 id="image-based-check-clearance-goes-live-today-which-banks-do-it-and-how-it-works">Image-based check clearance goes live today: which banks do it and how it works</h2>

<p>A new software being introduced in some banks and building societies this week, and fully implemented across all providers by the second half of 2018, will allow the UK check users – who cashed 477 million payments last year – to clear a check within 24 hours.</p>

<p>Banks including Barclays and Lloyds have already tested out imaging technology on their customers, but currently, only their own checks can be paid in. This UK-wide system will mean checks can be cashed in even if the check writer is from a different bank.</p>

<p>At the moment, when an individual receives a check and they deposit it at the bank, it can take up to six days for it to be processed through the clearing system. The new image-based check clearance, however, will take less time. Customers will still write paper checks as they do now, but when they take these to their bank or building society, the cashier will take a picture of the check which will then be exchanged electronically through the new system between the relevant banks and building societies.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-key-elements-defining-the-perfect-checkout-experience-in-m-commerce/">M-commerce</a>, given its relatively one-dimensional nature involving the consumer and a provider, is relatively easy to figure out. After years of trial and error, some of the challenges related to the technology for m-payments are gradually falling into place.</p>

<p>That said, the biggest difference between the two is related to the aggregation of disparate domains.</p>

<p>If we are strictly operating in the virtual environment, we can get away with collating different sources and presenting them to the end-user in the form of a catalog. Once a particular choice is made, a dedicated channel is established between the end-user and the provider domain. The business model is straightforward, and regulatory oversight is relatively simple.</p>

<p>In the real world, we are typically faced with two choices – we can either leapfrog or leverage the legacy environment. If we decide to leapfrog the legacy environment, adoption is relatively simple but then scale becomes a challenge. If we decide to leverage the legacy environment, figuring out adoption is challenging but once we do that, scaling the product or service becomes relatively easier. While there are exceptions to this all around, this is not a bad rule of thumb to follow in the ideation phase.</p>

<p>In many ways, this is also a good way of testing the disruption hypothesis.</p>

<p>The progression of m-commerce to m-payments is not just about moving from the virtual to the real world, but more importantly, it is about figuring out what aspect of <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-devils-advocate/">the shiny new gizmo</a> should be disruptive versus what aspect needs to leverage the legacy environment. At a tactical level, it is about figuring out all the challenges associated with true aggregation of disparate domains.</p>

<p>The challenges with m-payments are truly multi-dimensional. At a technology level, collation and presentation of a catalog will not accomplish true aggregation of all the disparate domains across the issuance and settlement environments. At a business level, the complexity of which entity pays in versus gets paid out is a lot more profound. At a regulatory level, well, we do not even know where to start but what we do know is that at a bare minimum, we will either need numerous existing regulators to come together in a single cohesive manner or we will need a brand new regulator that can truly understand and weigh in on all the different industries involved.</p>

<p>Given that we are just embarking on largely testing the technology elements of the m-payments space, we clearly have a long way to go before we can start calling the existing business models a success let alone lay the regulatory debate to rest.</p>

<p>While m-payments should get us off to a good start on the relevance scale, we will need to progress to m-transactions to get us to the magical number of 10 transactions a day. If we feel the current challenges with m-payments are daunting, how will we ever figure out what we need to do to drive adoption and consequently scale m-transactions?</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Amazon is nothing short of a modern business wonder – the company is aggressively entering industries with no limit in sight. Amazon started off selling books out of Bezos’ garage and is now the largest online retailer in the world of everything from electronics to groceries. The company is in cloud computing; shipping and logistics; and on and on.</p>

<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/epic-lesson-banks-can-learn-from-amazon/">Amazon reigns supreme because it has put the customer journey at the forefront of its business model</a>. Which begs the question that we at LTP asked: What are banks waiting for?</p>

<h2 id="big-tech-firms-like-amazon-are-eager-to-eat-the-banking-industrys-lunch">Big tech firms like Amazon are eager to eat the banking industry’s lunch</h2>

<p>The biggest technology players are eroding the boundaries between industries “as they seek to be all things to all people,” according to a recent McKinsey report. The biggest Asian tech firms show why banks should be worried: Rakuten, Japan’s largest online retail marketplace, runs one of the country’s largest online travel portals and its messaging app (which can suggest shopping items based on your recent chats) has about 800 million users. The company also issues credit cards and offers mortgages and securities services. China’s Alibaba is another big e-commerce company that also does brisk business as an asset manager, lender, and payments firm.</p>

<p>Tech companies are breaking into finance more slowly in the West, but it’s happening. Amazon now provides loans for small and medium-sized companies. Facebook is integrating person-to-person PayPal payments into its messenger app, and Apple will allow iMessage users to send cash to each other.</p>

<p>McKinsey describes the biggest risks for banks as the “four horsemen of the e-pocalypse.” That includes disintermediation, where financial firms are cut off from their customers by an upstart like Lending Club. Perhaps a bigger concern is that their businesses get unbundled; right now, they might lose money on checking accounts, but make the money back (and then some) when customers return to the bank for mortgages. That could be difficult to sustain if everything is routed through a messaging platform that banks don’t control. This leads to the two other big risks, of being left to compete solely on low-margin, commodified services and, ultimately, “losing brand awareness and becoming invisible as consumers can access financial services without knowing the brand,” McKinsey notes.</p>

<h2 id="amazon-has-obtained-pharmaceutical-wholesaler-licenses-in-12-states">Amazon Has Obtained Pharmaceutical Wholesaler Licenses In 12 States</h2>

<p>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Amazon has become a licensed pharmaceutical wholesaler in 12 states, with a pending application in a thirteenth. To ship drugs directly to consumers, competing with large pharmacy benefit managers and mail-order pharmacies like Caremark or Express Scripts, Amazon would also need to be licensed as a pharmacy in each state to which it shipped drugs.</p>

<p>The Post-Dispatch was able to confirm through public records that Amazon has been approved as a pharmaceutical wholesaler in the states of Alabama, Arizona, Connecticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon, and Tennessee. An application in Maine is still pending.</p>

<h2 id="amazon-now-has-a-1-billion-ad-business">Amazon now has a $1 billion ad business</h2>

<p>Amazon is making good on its promise to eat advertising.</p>

<p>In its third-quarter earnings report today, the e-commerce giant said it saw “other” revenue, which is mostly composed of ad sales (and to a much smaller extent, its credit card business), grow 58% year-over-year to $1.12 billion. That’s a slight increase from the growth rate in the prior second quarter when it grew 53% year over year.</p>

<p>(For comparison’s sake, Alphabet, Google’s parent company, which also reported third-quarter earnings today, reported ad sales at $24 billion. Facebook’s second-quarter ad sales were $9 billion; the company reports third-quarter earnings on November 11.)</p>

<p>“Ad revenue continues to grow very quickly,” CFO Brian Olsavsky said on the company’s earnings call. “We’re generally pleased with the ad business. Our goal is to be helpful to consumers and help them make better shopping decisions… while also giving them targeted recommendations, making it helpful for customers instead of intrusive.”</p>

<h2 id="amazon-shares-soar-as-earnings-beat-expectations">Amazon shares soar as earnings beat expectations</h2>

<p>Amazon reported net income of $256 million, or 52 cents per share, for the three months ending September 30. That easily beat the 2 cents per share analysts had expected, according to FactSet. Amazon has long been known for investing the money it makes back into its businesses, such as opening new warehouses to fulfill orders. Many seemed to expect that again.</p>

<p>Revenue rose 34% to $43.47 billion, beating the $41.58 billion analysts expected. The company said net sales included $1.3 billion from Whole Foods Market, which Amazon acquired on Aug. 28. After taking over Whole Foods, Amazon slashed prices, added its logo on signs and set up a stand of “farm fresh” Amazon Echo voice-assistant devices by store entrances.</p>

<p>For the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday season, the company expects revenue between $56 billion and $60.5 billion, up as much as 38% from the year before, and above what analysts expected. It expects to hire more than 120,000 temporary workers to help pack and sort orders for the holidays, the same number it hired last year.</p>

<p>When Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all released their quarterly earnings on Thursday, they did more than give onlookers an update on their particular businesses.</p>

<p>As the three major players in the cloud computing market, the companies provided a glimpse of the state of affairs in that ongoing battle. The reports make clear that Amazon Web Services, which is on track to post $18 billion in revenue this year, continues to have the upper hand.</p>

                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Did you know what a “no-action letter” is? Were you aware that the CFPB had an office of innovation? We recently caught up with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandra-villarreal-o-rourke-39631b28/">Alexandra Villarreal O’Rourke</a>, Financial Services Partner, FinTech Practice Group Co-leader at <a href="https://www.mcguirewoods.com/">McGuireWoods</a>, to learn more about the budding partnership of FinTech and the CFPB.</p>

<p>We love talking to Alex because she has a unique combination of technical, financial services, and legal expertise. We hope you enjoy the conversation!</p>

<p><strong>Patrick Rivenbark: Alex, thanks for joining us! Tell us a little bit about yourself first.</strong></p>

<p>Alexandra Villarreal O’Rourke: Thanks for having me. I’m a partner at McGuireWoods, a national law firm with offices all over the country as well as London and Brussels. I co-lead our FinTech group which means I do a lot of regulatory advising and general advising for FinTech companies. Essentially, I work with banks and non-banks that have regulatory questions or are interacting with regulators in some way.</p>

<p>As part of my practice, I work with FinTechs to understand how the laws apply to them: their technology and business. Most recently, I was at the CFPB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in DC, where I was a senior counsel expertise in FinTech. I worked very closely with the CFPB’s office of innovation called Project Catalyst, and I worked on broad policy initiatives to encourage innovation to foster progress in our industry.</p>

<p><strong>PR: Thank you! Needless to say, you know what you’re talking about when it comes to regulation and finance. Please expand a little more on Project Catalyst. What is it? Why did it start?</strong></p>

<p>AVO: Project Catalyst is, as I said, the CFPB’s office of innovation. Its goal is to serve as a liaison between the Bureau and the innovation community – not just within FinTech companies but also innovators within traditional financial institutions as well. So, encouraging consumer-friendly innovation is really their goal.</p>

<p>They do this in a few ways. They engage by hosting office hours, which means they open the Bureau’s doors to FinTech companies and innovators to hear and learn about consumer-friendly innovation. The conversations let innovators engage with the Bureau on how to leverage technology in a consumer-friendly and responsible way. Project Catalyst also establishes research partnerships on consumer-friendly initiatives.</p>

<p>They also manage the No-Action Letter Program, which we will talk a little bit more, but it is one of the ways in which the Bureau opines on new technologies that might not fit neatly within the current regulatory schemes.</p>

<p><strong>PR: Let’s talk about that particular No-Action Letter Program. In reviewing a company, what do they broadly review when they are looking at a company?</strong></p>

<p>AVO: The no-action letter is intended to encourage consumer-friendly innovation by addressing areas of legal uncertainty. An example is best: let’s say you are a company that is using new types of credit data or a new type of underwriting model that might not have been traditionally used before. Some of the laws that apply to underwriting were written in the ’70s. The frameworks and court decisions on those laws didn’t exactly anticipate the technology we have today, so now there is a really specific question – “Does this new use of underwriting technology comply with the law?” This is where the No-Action Program comes in – it’s designed to answer questions where the law’s application to a particular innovation might be unclear.</p>

<p>The company will present why they think the law is uncertain and why they think the product or service complies with the law. They will then ask the CFPB: “Can you tell us what you think?”</p>

<p>It’s important to note that the no-action letter is not a seal of approval. It is a way for the Bureau to inform a company about their application (including how the tech and safeguards work) and that the way they use the data won’t result in any enforcement action regarding a particular area of the law.</p>

<p><strong>PR: That makes sense. What if a company doesn’t engage to the CFPB?</strong></p>

<p>AVO: The scenario the no-action letter is trying to avoid is a situation where a company is doing something that is really consumer-friendly but there is no outlet for meaningful conversation.</p>

<p>Let’s say they are using certain data to create access to credit for an underserved market. It’s great for consumers – everybody loves it, the idea is really promising – but they are doing it in a way that is a technical misfit with the law. It violates some technical part of some law. And maybe the law is written in a way that’s not completely clear.</p>

<p>In a world without the no-action letter process, this is what would happen: the Bureau would just bring an enforcement action against you right away since you’re violating the law. The idea is, if you have a process where people can bring questions to you, you can address situations earlier (when they are easier to fix) and before enforcement is necessary. It’s a way to encourage innovators to come to the Bureau with their new ideas instead of just hoping the Bureau doesn’t come after them.</p>

<p><strong>PR: Most recently, the first no-action letter was issued to the Upstart Network. Can you explain what happened and its significance?</strong></p>

<p>AVO: Sure. And, to be clear, everything I’m going to share with you is from public information that came out when the no-action letter was announced. The Upstart Network is a lending platform that incorporates some non-traditional sources of data, such as education and employment history, in their credit decisions. The no­­-action letter for Upstart is a great example of the program at work. The Upstart Network presented to the CFPB about their technology and said, essentially, “We are not sure how fair lending laws apply to what we are doing.”</p>

<p>It’s not carte blanche but the no-action letter essentially says that the Bureau staff is not planning to recommend enforcement or supervisory action on the fair lending law as it applies to Upstart’s underwriting model. That is a huge deal for the market because it is the first time the Bureau has essentially publicly acknowledged that non-traditional credit data can be used in underwriting a way that doesn’t run afoul of fair lending laws.</p>

<p>What’s great about the situation now: Upstart is actually going to share data with the Bureau about how their model expands access to credit for traditionally underserved populations. That’s a huge opportunity for the Bureau to see, especially in terms of alternative data, what promise using this data might hold. Now, the Bureau is getting input from a FinTech company. It really highlights the program’s intention to be a partnership program; it’s not a one-way street. I mean, obviously Upstart is very happy to know that the Bureau does not currently have concerns with what they are currently doing, but the Bureau is also going to get the benefit of working with that company.</p>

<p><strong>PR: How do you hope this will help the move the industry forward with the CFPB?</strong></p>

<p>AVO: Yeah, so, the No-Action Program has been around for quite a while now, maybe two years. I think that until now there was some skepticism in the market about the Bureau ever finding the right company. I think the Upstart letter is almost like a proof of product for Project Catalyst. It shows that they actually do intend to issue no-action letters and believe it’s a partnership.</p>

<p>The Bureau wants to engage with innovators; they want to hear your ideas. Innovators can view Project Catalyst as a sounding board and not just a regulator to be afraid of. I think it actually will encourage more engagement like office hours and collaboration with the ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>PR: A truly engaged regulator as a partner can only be good for the industry and, importantly the consumer. Alex, thank you so much for talking with us and helping us understand the no-action program. I certainly learned something new!</strong></p>

<p>AVO: No problem! My pleasure.</p>

                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>October is <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/national-cyber-security-awareness-month">Cybersecurity Awareness Month</a>, and with the recent string of data breaches, protecting assets in an increasingly digital world is at the top of many consumers’ minds. While you’ve probably heard about the importance of enabling <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/10/15946642/two-factor-authentication-online-security-mess">two-factor authentication</a> (2FA) on your accounts (you might even be familiar with some common modes of <a href="https://www.payfone.com/">2FA</a> like those SMS codes your bank texts you, or 2FA apps that you need to download), did you know that there is an even easier and safer authentication method that works through your mobile phone? Called mobile identity authentication, this technology allows your phone to act as an ultra-secure way to protect yourself against cyber-fraud without having to type in a password, download an app, or fumble with annoying text passcodes. Intrigued? We were too, which is why we caught up with Rodger Desai, cybersecurity expert &amp; CEO of mobile identity authentication company <a href="http://www.payfone.com/">Payfone</a>, to learn more about how mobile identity authentication works and why so many enterprises, like the top US banks and healthcare organizations, are abandoning traditional authentication methods in favor of this more secure next-generation tech.</p>

<p><strong>LTP: What exactly is mobile identity authentication and how does it work? How is it different from more traditional methods of authentication like knowledge-based answers and one-time passcodes?</strong></p>

<p>RD: Mobile identity authentication leverages the encryption technology that mobile networks already use every time you make a call or send a text to provide an ultra-secure and reliable way to determine whether the person trying to log into your bank, healthcare or any other type of account is really you. When we first started Payfone, we were fascinated by the fact that mobile phones solved a problem that the web wasn’t able to. When you make a call or send a text, your phone doesn’t ask you who you are or what your password is first. And when you land in another country and turn your phone on, it just knows that it’s you – even if you’re in a country where your own mobile carrier doesn’t offer coverage. It’s all done through a cryptographic sequence sent between your phone’s SIM card and your mobile network – essentially the network sends a set of complex math problems that only your SIM can answer. Payfone extends this seamless yet super-secure mobile technology to the web. When you sign in to your accounts, our technology can see that it’s really you. Likewise, we can see if it’s someone pretending to be you, and lock that person out of your accounts. And we can do this on any digital channel – mobile, web, voice, text, etc.</p>

<p>The main difference between mobile identity authentication and traditional 2FA methods is that traditional methods require human intervention and are therefore vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)">social engineering</a> – the manipulation of individuals into divulging confidential or personal information through phishing attacks and other methods of deception. With traditional 2FA methods, the human must do something – whether it’s entering a password, typing in a one-time passcode, or answering questions like your pet’s name – and that is the weakness that hackers exploit.</p>

<p>What’s different about Payfone is that we fortify the process by eliminating the human from the equation – and unlike other solutions, we don’t require a separate app or a physical token to do that. Through our partnerships with mobile network operators and our sophisticated algorithms, which cannot be deceived by SIM swap fraud and intercepted SMS passcodes, we can see whether it’s you or a fraudster without having to ask you to do anything.</p>

<p>The market is slowly but surely <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/10/15946642/two-factor-authentication-online-security-mess">recognizing the need to move away from traditional methods</a> like hijackable one-time passcodes and knowledge-based questions that don’t fully protect customers. And it’s exciting that they’re also recognizing our way as the future.</p>

<p>“As a fraud risk manager, I am continuously looking for tools and services that are highly effective at identifying and validating digital identities while still allowing customers the right and ability to manage their privacy. Payfone is one of the leading vendors in the Digital Identity verification space that has built into the DNA of their solution the requirement to manage the customer’s privacy, and this is one of the several differentiators it has.” – David Fapohunda, Director, Financial Crimes Unit, PricewaterhouseCoopers</p>

<p><strong>LTP: The last time we spoke in June, Payfone had just announced their <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/sim-swap-fraud-patent-awarded-to-payfone/">patented SIM swap fraud prevention solution</a>. What other kinds of attacks should consumers be on the lookout for?</strong></p>

<p>RD: Last year in the US, roughly 30 million phone numbers were disconnected (and therefore subject to being reassigned to other people), 80 million consumers switched phone companies, and 130 million consumers activated new phones. That is a lot of activity – and a dream for fraudsters who try to sneak in amidst that activity. Putting this is into even more perspective, fraudsters stole a whopping $16 billion last year from consumers and companies using attacks like SIM swap fraud, porting fraud and other forms of account takeover.</p>

<p>Again, the common thread with all of these attacks is that they are nearly impossible to protect against using traditional authentication methods because once an attacker has control of your phone number, many of the traditional safeguards companies use (like one-time passcodes) are rendered futile. Plus, when a hacker assumes control of your phone number, your own phone goes dead. So you may not even be able to call your bank right away to shut down your accounts. It’s like keeping all of your money in a safe that burglars already have the combination to. It just doesn’t make sense.</p>

<p><strong>LTP: Now that we know a little more about the different kinds of threat vectors that have been circulating, what is being done to combat these attacks?</strong></p>

<p>RD: As more companies realize how easy it is for hackers to <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2124681/social-engineering/security-awareness-social-engineering-the-basics.html">social engineer</a> their way past traditional authentication methods, they are turning to mobile identity authentication, which is impervious to social engineering attacks. We in the mobile identity authentication industry have also been doing our part to raise awareness for the efficacy of this new and better way of doing things.</p>

<p>Last month, US mobile network operators announced the formation of their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/08/mobile-authentication-taskforce-att-verizon-tmobile-sprint/">Mobile Authentication Taskforce</a> to create a more secure standard of authentication that builds upon their existing technologies. The creation of this task force is a key step towards adopting a new authentication standard that will benefit our country’s consumers, and it is also strong evidence that our mobile network partners are committed to supporting us and our mission for the long haul.</p>

<p>“At a time when online and digital services are commonplace, security and authentication are issues that affect us all,” said Alex Sinclair, Chief Technology Officer, <a href="https://www.gsma.com/">GSMA</a>, in a <a href="http://about.att.com/story/att_teams_to_develop_mobile_authentication_solution.html">release announcing the Mobile Authentication Taskforce</a>. “Through strong collaboration, the task force announced today has the potential to create impactful benefits for US customers by helping to decrease fraud and identity theft, and increase trust in online transactions. Further, we will be working closely with the task force to ensure this solution is aligned and interoperable with solutions deployed by operators.”</p>

<p>Payfone has also been doing our part to raise awareness about how mobile identity authentication can save companies and consumers from falling victim to hackers. We frequently issue <a href="https://www.payfone.com/press/">press releases</a>, serve as conference panelists and speak with the security community and reporters. Recent examples include this <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/01/cyberattacks-rely-on-consumers-and-thats-a-problem-says-anti-fraud-app-ceo.html">CNBC article</a> and this <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-ways-can-get-hacked-smartphone-191055310.html">Yahoo! Finance piece</a>, where we shared our insights into new types of phone fraud. There are many more articles on <a href="https://www.payfone.com/">our website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>LTP: You mentioned that companies have been taking notice of and adopting mobile identity authentication, but how can individual consumers take advantage of Payfone’s services?</strong></p>

<p>RD: While individual consumers cannot use Payfone directly, they do reap the benefits of our anti-fraud products through the banks, insurance companies and healthcare providers who use Payfone. It should be noted that each potential client must be approved by each mobile operator, and auditable end-user consent must be collected and stored for each consumer. It’s a rigorous process that assures that all of our processes are in accordance with regulations and our mission to protect consumers.</p>

<p>Of course, if you really want to be protected by Payfone, one thing you can do is call your bank, your health insurance company and other service providers and demand that they use Payfone! All joking aside though, one way that you can help to safeguard yourself is to check with your mobile operator to make sure that your information on file is accurate. This is a bit of an oversimplification, but what Payfone’s algorithms essentially do is to match your real information on file with the information of the person who is claiming to be you to log into your accounts. If our analytics say it’s not a match, the person claiming to be you cannot get in and needs to go through more scrutiny. So the more accurate you keep your information, the better and easier it is for us to protect you.</p>

<p><strong>LTP: When you say that you match information, does that mean that you store my personal information? What does that mean in terms of data privacy?</strong></p>

<p>RD: That’s a great question and one that seems to be on a lot of people’s minds, so I’m grateful to be able to answer it here. Payfone only uses personal information to match and create scores that are passed along to empower enterprise clients to make their own risk decisions. Payfone does not sell personally identifiable information. Clients must also disclose and notify, and in certain use cases, obtain explicit opt-in consent from end-users before they can make use of our cybersecurity products. Clients who have worked with us know how committed we are to data privacy.</p>

<p><strong>LTP: Can you share an example of a client who uses you and what their experience has been?</strong></p>

<p>RD: While we can’t give the names of our clients for security reasons, one prime example of how our technology protects both our customers and their users is a leading cryptocurrency exchange that became our client recently. Since going live with us, they have reported zero successful attacks due to SIM swap or porting fraud. We can actually see the attempted attacks happening and can actively thwart them. This client is committed to safeguarding their users with the latest anti-fraud technology and has been elated with our ability to deliver that for them.</p>

<p><strong>LTP: What’s on the horizon for Payfone, and where do you see the company going from here?</strong></p>

<p>RD: We’re going to be authenticating 50,000,000 transactions per day for 6 of the top 10 banks in the United States by year-end, so we are looking forward to reaching that momentous milestone. We’re also branching out further outside of the financial sphere with even more clients in the healthcare, high-tech and retail sectors going live in 2018. Geographically, we have begun moving into Europe and Asia and will be continuing our global expansion into 35 new markets. We’re excited to be sharing our services with even more companies and safeguarding more users worldwide.</p>

<h2 id="the-next-wave-of-authentication-will-be-mobile-centric">The next wave of authentication will be mobile-centric</h2>

<p>As devices allow individuals to be more mobile, habits change; unfortunately, so does the cyberthreat. Mobile devices are playing an immense role in one’s daily routine, becoming a gateway into the most private data across personal accounts. Slowly but surely, cross-industry stakeholders are recognizing the need to move away from traditional authentication methods in favor of more advanced authentication standard that can fully protect customers.</p>

<p>The next generation of security solutions will serve as a connective tissue between telcos, financial institutions, insurance companies and other critical stakeholders to ensure the utmost accuracy of information in order to facilitate the highest protection standards to the end-user.</p>

<h2 id="author-note">Author note</h2>

<p>Payfone investors include American Express, IDology, RRE Ventures, Rogers Venture Partners (RVP), Opus Capital, BlueCross BlueShield Venture Partners, Early Warning, Relay Ventures, and Verizon.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Apple Pay has admittedly went through its fair share of bumpy roads and will encounter more as it rolls out around the world. <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/is-apple-pay-leading-from-behind-again/">Underestimation of the solution</a>, and mobile contactless payments, in particular, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/is-the-dusk-of-mobile-apps-inevitable/">have not been ungrounded</a>. Nonetheless, numbers don’t lie, Apple Pay has revealed impressive data indicating the potential of the solution, which is proven to be a favored payments method when made available.</p>

<h2 id="apple-pay-now-in-20-markets-nabs-90-of-all-mobile-contactless-transactions-where-active">Apple Pay now in 20 markets, nabs 90% of all mobile contactless transactions where active</h2>

<p>Merchants and others who have partnered with Apple say that Apple Pay is accounting for 90% of all mobile contactless transactions globally in markets where it’s available.</p>

<p>“Apple Pay is the future of everyday spend,” <a href="https://twitter.com/alarabasul/status/922262055951900673">said</a> Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s VP of Apple Pay, on stage at the Money20/20 conference that kicked off in Las Vegas yesterday.</p>

<p>Bailey also announced that the service is launching in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the UAE in the next few days, bringing the total number of countries where it is used up to 20. And she said that 4,000 issuers worldwide now work with the wallet (that is, there are now 4,000 credit and debit card issuers whose cards can now be uploaded to and used via Apple Pay).</p>

<p>While these may not sound like massive numbers on their own, 20 markets represents a full 70% of the world’s card transaction volume, she noted. This underscores how Apple is approaching the rollout of its payment service: it is moving first to where the money is.</p>

                <title>London – Still The #1 FinTech Hub</title>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Investors have poured more than <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/19/london-is-top-europe-hotspot-for-vc-investment.html">$1 billion</a> into British FinTech companies since the beginning of 2017. In H1 2017, UK attracted <a href="https://new.innovatefinance.com/news/global-vc-fintech-investment-attracts-6-5-billion-h1-2017-uk-investment-37-reveals-innovate-finance/">$564 million</a> of VC investment, up 37% on H1 2016. FinTech is worth <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/britains-fintech-boom-pushes-finance-trademarks-record-high-2017-10">$9.25 billion</a> to the UK economy and now employs 60,000 people. “FinTech is a real asset for the UK’s economy and we are a global leader in our own right,” Catherine McGuinness, Chairman of the Policy and Resources Committee at the City of London Corporation, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/16/london-to-remain-fintech-hub-of-europe-despite-brexit-study-says.html">said </a>earlier in October 2017.</p>

<p>The whole nation is embracing FinTech. About 77% of UK businesses are aware of FinTech products and services and 65% have adopted at least one FinTech application, with a fifth (19%) taking on four. <a href="https://blog.marketinvoice.com/2017/09/25/65-uk-businesses-embrace-fintech/">MarketInvoice</a>, a London-based invoice financing firm found that these as result of using FinTech products and services, adopters reported saving (on average) over £5,500 a year. Just a week ago, <a href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/bny-mellon-and-hsbc-team-with-london-fintech-to-boost-bond-liquidity-20171017">BNY Mellon and HSBC have each teamed up with London-based startup Algomi</a>, which is backed by exchange operator Euronext and analytics firm S&amp;P Global, in a bid to revivify trading in the corporate bond market.</p>

<p>Out of the handsome sum of $1 billion invested into British FinTech, $980 million – 90% of all FinTech investments in the country – was raised by FinTech firms in London.</p>

<p>Despite unflattering expectations, this year is set to become the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-fintech-investment/uk-fintech-investment-set-for-record-breaking-year-in-2017-idUSKBN1CO026">record year for FinTech in London</a>. The count goes almost a million in a day – just a day ago, <a href="https://countingup.com/">Countingup</a>, a London-based company that brings together business banking and accounting, picked up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/23/countingup/">€750,000</a> in a funding round led by Frontline Ventures.</p>

<p>“London remains a world leader in FinTech,” <a href="http://www.londonandpartners.com/media-centre/press-releases/2017/20171019-europes-number-one-fintech-hub-for-global-investors">said</a> the Deputy Mayor of London for Business, <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/people/mayoral/rajesh-agrawal">Rajesh Agrawal</a>. “More than £1 billion in venture capital has been invested into London’s FinTech sector since the EU referendum – this is yet more proof that global investors believe London will remain a leading FinTech hub for many years to come.</p>

<p>Clearly, Brexit poses major challenges – but London’s position as a global financial center and world-class technology hub is built on strong foundations which cannot be replicated anywhere else: access to more software developers than Stockholm, Berlin and Dublin combined, Europe’s largest FinTech accelerator <a href="http://www.level39.co/">Level39</a>, and the continent’s only truly global financial market.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.londonandpartners.com/media-centre/press-releases/2017/20171019-europes-number-one-fintech-hub-for-global-investors">London &amp; Partners</a>, Mayor of London’s official promotional agency, suggests that in the past five years, London’s FinTech sector has received more than five times the amount of investment than any other major European city. Since 2012, London FinTech companies attracted more VC money than Paris, Frankfurt, Berlin, and Amsterdam combined.</p>

<p>“London is the optimal place to set up and scale a FinTech company,” Yoyo’s CEO Alain Falys shared with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/19/london-is-top-europe-hotspot-for-vc-investment.html">CNBC</a>. “Thanks to the unique ecosystem we have in the city — which gives us access to talent, capital, forward-looking retailers and consumers — we’ve grown into a major brand in a very short period of time, becoming Europe’s fastest-growing loyalty and mobile payments provider.”</p>

<p>London consistently attracts foreign direct investments (FDI) from around the world. Between 2006 and 2016, <a href="http://files.londonandpartners.com/l-and-p/assets/fdi_report_2006_2016_web.pdf">the capital has recorded investments from 67 different countries</a>. The US, India, China, Japan and Spain together accounted for <a href="http://files.londonandpartners.com/l-and-p/assets/fdi_report_2006_2016_web.pdf">56%</a> of the investment. Of top source countries, the fastest-growing contributors to FDI into London are China, which has seen a tenfold increase over the last 10 years, Italy (+450%), and Canada (+400%).</p>

<p>Not only London is killing it with FinTech in 2017, the <a href="http://www.zyen.com/component/content/article.html?id=240">Global Financial Centers Index</a> (GFCI) places London at the top financial center among vibrant, competitive financial centers that give cities economic advantages in information, knowledge, and access to capital. GFCI shows that London and New York are the two leading global financial centers, with Hong Kong and Singapore ranked third and fourth respectively, closely followed by Zurich, Frankfurt, Geneva, Chicago, Tokyo, and Sydney.</p>

<p>“Whether you look at it from the perspective of talent, infrastructure, access to capital or the excellent regulatory environment, London is without question the best city in the world to launch a FinTech startup. In just two years, Revolut has raised over $90m in investment and attracted over 900,000 users. There is no doubt in my mind that a large part of our success is down to choosing London and the UK as our headquarters and home,” <a href="http://www.londonandpartners.com/media-centre/press-releases/2017/20171019-europes-number-one-fintech-hub-for-global-investors">emphasized</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nstoronsky/">Nikolay Storonsky</a>, CEO of <a href="https://www.revolut.com/us/usa">Revolut</a> (raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/11/revolut-raises-66-million-for-its-global-banking-alternative/">$66 million</a> in a funding round in July).</p>

                    <p>An ever-innovative giant in P2P payments exceeds expectations another time with its Q3 earnings results. In Q3 2017, PayPal added 8.2 million net new active accounts – a record addition to the platform in a quarter. PayPal ended the quarter with approximately 70 million consumer accounts opted into One Touch, and approximately 6 million merchants accepting One Touch.</p>

<p>More importantly, the company continues to make aggressive strides to create a strong supportive network. Since early 2016, the company added 26 partnership agreements.</p>

<p>The software prototypes of three different models for decentralized interbank payment and settlements have been successfully developed by the blockchain consortium led by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state’s central bank and financial regulator, and the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS).</p>

<p>The project, conducted together with 11 financial institutions and five technology companies, is the Phase 2 of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/singapore-central-bank-uses-ethereum-digitalize-national-currency/">Project Ubin</a>, which explored the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) for clearing and settlement of payments and securities.</p>

<p>Project Ubin was triggered in late-2016 with an aim to better understand blockchain and its potential benefits through practical experimentation. MAS has said that “digital central bank issued tokens” could enable the development of simpler to use and more efficient alternatives to today’s systems.</p>

<p>In Singapore, OCBC Bank, HSBC, and MUFG are already working on a <a href="https://www.ocbc.com/assets/pdf/media/2017/october/media%20release%20-%20ocbc%20hsbc%20and%20mufg%20together%20with%20imda%20complete%20proof%20of%20concept%20on%20aseans%20first%20industry%20kyc%20blockchain_web.pdf">KYC blockchain project</a> to eliminate the duplicity of KYC processes and provide more convenience to customers and efficiency across the banks.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Rational. That’s how I’d describe banking, trading, and finance generally at its core – for better or worse. When you strip it down, FinServ is a giant, global spreadsheet of increasingly complex formulas spitting out dividends, interest, debts, credits, and transfers. Unfortunately, we humans have a flaw of being, well, human: imperfect, irrational, and emotional. What do humans really latch on to? A story.</p>

<p>It’s this struggle that makes financial services truly interesting. Most of you, I presume, love a good quantitative breakdown of companies, assets, and trends. Show me the numbers! We grasp it. We understand it. There is an answer. In part, this hyper-rational focus is why FinTech’s meteoric growth seems a more controlled. On the other hand, everyone loves a good story. Blockchain will displace banks. AI will disrupt financial services. The future of banking is…</p>

<p>Stories seem like liberal arts fluff; however, they are critical to business, markets, customers, and your employees. Ask yourself why you have all-hands meetings? What’s the point of earnings calls, product launches, and marketing? Every product, service, or market needs a lot of people to believe in it for it to work. So, this week we look at:</p>

<h2 id="what-can-the-mighty-mobile-wallet-learn-from-mcdonalds">What Can the Mighty Mobile Wallet Learn From McDonald’s?</h2>

<p>“So what does McDonald’s have to do with delivering sustainable secure mobile transactions for consumers across diverse demographics and across disparate markets around the world?</p>

<p>Everything, if we want to start understanding the considerations and challenges associated with scale.”</p>

<p>The great thing about a good story is that everyone can learn from it and apply it to their own lives. A common motif in the FinTech narrative, particularly when you talk to larger banks, is that FinTechs aren’t ready for their scale. It’s as if a bootstrapped, technical co-founder had never considered their MVP isn’t ready for the global demands of a Tier 1 bank. That said, both the banks and FinTechs can learn from a global brand like McDonald’s. How do you build the culture, infrastructure, and know-how to deliver a new experience to every customer, every day with a consistent result? For banks, the challenge is reimagining your own company and employees. For FinTechs, it is delivering a valuable product today, selling the future, and building a team to execute.</p>

<h2 id="tezos-ico-is-officially-under-investigation">Tezos ICO Is Officially Under Investigation</h2>

<p>“After raising US $230 million in funding through its ICO, things started to unravel for Tezos. Not only is the trading of tokens delayed indefinitely, there is also a beef between the project’s foundation and the actual founders. It is evident this matter will not be resolved amicably anytime soon, which only brings more negative attention to this particular project. With the new investigation underway, things will only heat up even more.”</p>

<p>Talk about a plot twist. If you were following the crypto world around the time of the ICO, then you may remember Tezos was everywhere. Tezos had a great story: a new blockchain that improved upon all other blockchains; <a href="https://www.tezos.com/">in its own words:</a> “a new, decentralized blockchain that governs itself by establishing a true digital commonwealth.” (Serious question: are there lots of fake digital commonwealths?) The Tezos ICO raised the equivalent of $230M USD for a promise! That’s a powerful story. An almost-quarter-billion-dollar powerful story.</p>

<p>Today, there is infighting, suspended token trading, and no real product to show. You have to wonder how the latest chapter in the Tezos story will impact its future regardless of how good the tech may or may not be. We certainly can’t wait for the next installment.</p>

                <link>http://localhost:4000/2017/10/23/convenience-and-security-alone-will-not-save-the-day/</link>
                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/22-companies-leveraging-blockchain-for-identity-management-and-authentication/">Identity management</a>, which encapsulates the issues of security and <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/privacy-is-not-personal-rather-a-community-concern/">privacy</a>, will be one of the most critical factors to ensure that secure m-transactions can successfully scale. Security of an individual’s data will have to become the responsibility of a trusted community, where the risk and rewards of accessing an individual’s data are stacked up for the consumer rather than against. Effectively, the issue of security will dovetail into the larger issue of privacy, and the key will be to find the right balance between disclosure and oversight.</p>

<p>Whether we take a relatively simplistic view where everyone in the trusted ecosystem is equally incentivized to ensure an individual’s privacy, or the rather more complex view where an individual truly has the technical and regulatory tools available to manage and monetize her or his own personal data through the trusted ecosystem, the essence of security and consequently privacy will distil down to identity – how it is created, stored, transacted, managed, and ultimately terminated.</p>

<p>The next issue that will have to be managed extremely well at scale is customer support. As we are still in the relatively early stages of driving adoption for most initiatives, we can get away with redirecting those pesky customer support calls. Early adopters are perfectly fine being asked to call their bank if the card is a problem, or their merchant if the receipt doesn’t match, or their carrier if a bad connection resulted in the loss of a transaction.</p>

<p>At scale, someone will have to figure out how customer support will be provided for millions of consumers conducting at least 10 transactions a day across at least five different verticals. No one has yet started to focus on the larger issue of customer support at scale, where redirecting will not be an option, and the staff or system fielding the first level support calls will need unfettered access to all the relevant data points across numerous different providers, some of whom may actually be competitors in the trusted ecosystem.</p>

<p>Along with identity management and customer support, the third most critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure scale is the business model. The issue of privacy has never been about restricting access but rather about clearly defining in tangible terms what the provider is willing to give the consumer in return for access to sensitive personal data. Finding the right incentive for the consumer to take that leap of faith will not be as easy as offering up a free fifth cup of coffee or free delivery.</p>

<p>Providers in a trusted ecosystem will have to come up with a business model whereby they can offer an extremely tangible and enticing value proposition to the consumer to jump onto the grid. Such a tangible and recurring value proposition will have to be built around cost savings extracted across the entire trusted ecosystem.</p>

<p>From a consumer’s perspective, all this great technological advancement that keeps touting increasing levels of efficiency has to translate into something tangible. From a provider’s perspective, the challenge will be figuring out how the sum of all is actually less than the individual parts.</p>

<p>One way or the other if the providers want to scale m-transactions they will have to figure out the business model for transferring value creation back to the consumer. Promising additional convenience and security alone will not save the day.</p>

                <title>Rediscovering Discover – The Network of Networks</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/2017/10/20/rediscovering-discover-the-network-of-networks/</link>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>International tourists spent close to <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.TVLX.CD">$1.4 trillion</a> during their cross-border adventures in 2015. Since international tourism is one of the largest sources of income for a significant number of destinations around the world – in developing countries and developed ones – the banking industry has had to evolve their instruments to ensure that costs associated with international payments are democratized enough, and, at the same time, leverage the opportunity to profitably prime the traveling population to incur significant expenses.</p>

<p>Regardless of how far the FinServ industry has come in stacking up perks on credit cards, one of the biggest consumer pain points in international payments remains intact – foreign transaction fees.</p>

<p>But what if I told you that there is one network operating across 185 countries that allows cardholders to make foreign payments with no foreign transaction fees? It’s time to rediscover Discover Financial Services – one of the most unique global FinServ businesses.</p>

<p>Discover started its journey in 1985 and <a href="https://www.discover.com/company/our-company/">introduced its first cash reward credit card</a> in 1986. Discover was the first in the industry to introduce a cash rewards card and also offer 24/7 customer service without charging an annual fee, all of which was almost unheard of back in 1986. Today, Discover Global Network features more than 70 million cardholders, 37 million merchant acceptance locations and one million ATM and cash access locations across 185 countries and territories.</p>

<p>The company’s <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/936756523/files/doc_financials/quarterly_results/2017/Q2/DFS-Earnings-Release-2Q17-FINAL.pdf">Q2 2017 financial report</a> reveals that Discover credit card loans reached $61.8 billion and Discover card sales volume increased 5% from the prior year. Consumer deposits grew $3.6 billion (11%) from the prior year to $37.7 billion. Payment services’ transaction dollar volume stood at $50.1 billion. In Q2 2017, Discover Financial Services reported net income of $546 million.</p>

<p>Long story short, Discover of 2017 is a massive and, more importantly, an innovative business. One of the hallmarks of Discover is that the institution is both the network provider and an issuer. The model utilized by competitors is different – Visa and Mastercard operate networks and partner with issuers to issue issuer-specific cards. Why is this important?</p>

<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/overview-of-the-payments-industry/">Revenue models applied to financial instruments</a> are complex, and they include a variety of fees – transactional, flat fees, and incidental fees, each of which can be broken down into a dozen other fees. In this case, we care about <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/discovers-network-of-networks-strategy-makes-it-more-global-and-much-bigger-than-it-appears/">two</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Issuer fees: The issuers charge cardholders interest on their purchases and cash transactions. Some issuers also charge its users an annual fee just for the privilege of carrying their card. Apart from that, they also charge other potential fees – for cash advances, late payment, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Association (network) fees: Banks that issue cards with certain network providers’ brands have to pay fees to be associated with the network.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Being a network and an issuer, Discover is able to offer unique benefits to Discover cardholders that are rooted in operational efficiency and network reach.</p>

<p>Discover Network is a comprehensive, payments network accepted at millions of merchant locations in the US, Canada, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. Discover’s power is magnified by the two core networks it is built on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Diners Club International introduced the first multipurpose charge card to the world in 1950. Currently, Diners Club International has over 26 million merchant acceptance locations and 1.9 million ATM and cash access locations across 185 countries and territories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PULSE is one of the nation’s leading debit/ATM networks. PULSE provides cardholders with access to 1.8 million ATMs worldwide.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Discover is also accepted by three major mobile wallets – Apple Pay, Samsung Pay (&gt;5 million monthly customers), and Android Pay (&gt;5 million monthly users).</p>

<p>A hallmark of the Discover Network is its approach to acceptance expansion. Discover Network itself is strategically picking global partner networks to ensure the backing of the leading institutions across pan-regional markets – the ones that have the most scale and reach. More importantly, the potential of this growth is fueled by the partnerships that Discover acceptance members create themselves.</p>

<p>For example, in mid-September 2017, Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Industry and Trade (VietinBank) <a href="http://vietnamnews.vn/bizhub/393641/vietinbank-becomes-diners-club-card-issuer.html#XLRQUQ4BPXOME30w.97">signed a partnership agreement</a> to become the only issuer of Diners Club cards in Vietnam. The agreement helps to expand VietinBank’s existing acquisition relationship with Diners Club International Ltd, a business unit and wholly-owned subsidiary of Discover Financial Services and a part of the Discover Global Network. The Diners Club cards have the same issuance process and method of use as international credit and debit cards. In addition to the functions of international credit cards, such as internet payments, point-of-sale payments, withdrawals and accessing transaction history, cardholders also enjoy many discounts across more than 30 countries at restaurants, hotels and shopping centers.</p>

<p>Earlier, in January 2017, Discover Financial Services also entered a landmark <a href="https://investorrelations.discover.com/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/Discover-and-Paypal-Partner-to-Deliver-New-Digital-Payment-Experiences/default.aspx">agreement</a> with PayPal, making PayPal more widely available to Discover cardmembers, acquirers and merchants. The agreement provides PayPal access to Discover’s tokenization services, expanding PayPal’s reach at POS, which will enable US PayPal customers to pay with their Discover cards at all of the contactless-enabled merchants that accept Discover. As part of the agreement, Discover and PayPal plan to enable PayPal customers with eligible Discover cards to use their Cashback Bonus to pay for purchases at the millions of online and mobile merchants that accept PayPal. After enablement, Discover cardmembers will be able to view and use their available Cashback Bonus while using PayPal to pay for all or part of the largest card network in Brazil, Elo.</p>

<h2 id="how-discover-amplified-its-global-footprint-through-partnerships">How Discover amplified its global footprint through partnerships</h2>

<p>To map the scale that the third-largest network in the world was able to reach, it’s enough to look at just a few of Discover’s alliance members.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-19%20at%206.43.59%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2017-10-19 at 6.43.59 PM.png" /></p>

<p>Needless to mention, Discover covers a network of <a href="https://www.discovernetwork.com/en-us/business-resources/find-an-acquirer">80+ acquirers</a> covering the needs of businesses around the world.</p>

<h3 id="americas">Americas</h3>

<p><strong>Brazil</strong>: The largest card network in Brazil, Elo offers a wide variety of credit, debit and prepaid cards with approximately 80 million cards issued. The Discover-Elo partnership became <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/22230-2/">the first network-to-network partnership in Latin America</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Puerto Rico</strong>: ATH is a regional debit payment and ATM Network that offers acceptance and ATM access throughout Puerto Rico.</p>

<p><strong>Canada</strong>: In 2015, Global Payments, one of the leading worldwide providers of payment technology services, and Discover Financial Services <a href="https://investors.globalpaymentsinc.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=901290">announced</a> a streamlined acceptance solution for Discover cards for merchants in Canada. The new program was meant to simplify acceptance of Discover, Diners Club International, PULSE and affiliated network cards for Global Payments’ Canadian merchants, offering a comprehensive solution which provides value by offering a single statement.</p>

<p>In May 2017, Discover also entered into an <a href="https://investorrelations.discover.com/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/Discover-Global-Network-Signs-Deal-with-Desjardins-Group-to-Expand-Merchant-Credit-Card-Acceptance-in-Canada/default.aspx">agreement</a> with Desjardins Group, the leading cooperative financial group in Canada, through its Monetico payment solutions, to expand acceptance in Canada. Merchants that have business relationships with Desjardins are now able to accept cards that run on the Discover Global Network, including Discover, Diners Club and alliance partner cards. Desjardins Group is the sixth-largest cooperative financial group in the world, with assets close to $260 billion.</p>

<p>In North America, Discover is accepted at more merchants in the US than Amex and is now comparable to MasterCard and Visa. It’s also accepted in many Latin American countries including Colombia and Ecuador.</p>

<h3 id="asia">Asia</h3>

<p><strong>Japan</strong>: In 2006, Discover Financial Services and JCB agreed to an arrangement that will facilitate acceptance of JCB cards on the Discover Network in the US, and of Discover Network cards on the JCB network in Japan, and acceptance of PULSE cards at targeted ATMs in Japan at the option of the card issuer. In 2007, Discover Network began enabling its systems so that JCB cardholders were able to use their JCB cards at Discover Network merchant locations throughout the United States. Upon completion of a JCB system enhancement, Discover Network cardholders were able to use their cards for purchases at JCB merchant locations and for cash advances at targeted ATMs throughout Japan beginning in 2008. Currently, JCB is the only international payments network in Japan, with around 2.5 million merchants in 190 countries and territories.</p>

<p><strong>India</strong>: In 2012, Discover Financial Services has entered into a strategic alliance with the RuPay. Supported by the Central Bank of India, RuPay is a national payment network with merchants and ATMs across India.</p>

<p><strong>South Korea</strong>: In 2010, Discover Financial Services entered an <a href="https://www.dinersclub.com/about-us/press/discover-announces-alliance-with-koreas-bc-card">agreement</a> with BC Card, currently the largest domestic payments network in South Korea, allowing BC Card cardholders to utilize the Discover, Diners Club International and PULSE networks for international purchases and cash access outside of Korea, and ATM locations worldwide.</p>

<p><strong>China</strong>: In 2005, Discover Financial Services, then a business unit of Morgan Stanley, and owner of Discover Network and PULSE ATM/debit network have <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050526005350/en/Discover-Financial-Services-China-UnionPay-Announce-Strategic">signed a long-term agreement</a> that led to acceptance of Discover Network Cards at China UnionPay ATMs and POS terminals in China and acceptance of China UnionPay cards on the PULSE network in the US. Both sides agreed to pursue ways to enable acceptance of China UnionPay cards at Discover Network’s more than four million merchant and cash access locations in North America. Currently, China UnionPay has more than 3.5 billion members, 4.8 million merchants and 415,000 ATMs spread across mainland China.</p>

<p>In mid-September 2017, Allinpay, one of China’s leading alternative payment providers, and Diners Club International, a part of the Discover Global Network, <a href="https://investorrelations.discover.com/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/Allinpay-to-Grow-Acceptance-for-Diners-Club-International-in-Hong-Kong/default.aspx">announced</a> that Allinpay is now an acquirer for all cards that run on the Discover Global Network. Allinpay merchants are now able to accept Discover, Diners Club International and affiliate partner cards, increasing acceptance in the Hong Kong region. Allinpay is one of the few financial institutions in China that possesses full scope payment licenses spanning online, offline, domestic, cross-border, acquiring and issuing. At present, Allinpay acquires over 1.5 million merchants.</p>

<p><strong>Vietnam</strong>: In 2010, Discover Financial Services <a href="https://investorrelations.discover.com/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details/2016/Discover-Global-Network-Signs-with-Computop-to-Increase-International-E-Commerce-Merchant-Acceptance/default.aspx">announced</a> an alliance with Smartlink Card. JSC, a leading domestic payments network in Vietnam, that gave Discover and Diners Club International cardholders the ability to use their cards at more than 16,000 ATMs in Vietnam via a network of local commercial banks.</p>

<p>Currently, Discover is in a partnership with the National Payment Corporation of Vietnam (NAPAS), which offers access to thousands of ATMs in Vietnam via a network of 51 local financial institutions.</p>

<h3 id="middle-east">Middle East</h3>

<p>Mercury is a large domestic card network that provides POS and ATM acceptance throughout the <strong>Middle East</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="europe">Europe</h3>

<p><strong>Serbia</strong>: As the largest acquiring network in Serbia, DinaCard has more than 2.5 million members in the region.</p>

<p>EMEA acceptance includes Austria, Egypt, Israel, Portugal, Greece, Slovakia, South Africa and the UAE, to name a few.</p>

<h3 id="africa">Africa</h3>

<p><strong>Nigeria</strong>: Interswitch allows Discover Global Network to access purchases and cash accounts in Nigeria.</p>

<p>Moreover, &gt;68 million cards, issued by 600 EUFISERV member banks, can participate in the PULSE Global ATM Network.</p>

<p>Discover has always been a consumer-centric organization despite all internal and external developments (no wonder it’s ranked <a href="https://investorrelations.discover.com/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/Discover-Ranked-Second-among-Direct-Banks-for-Highest-Customer-Satisfaction-by-JD-Power/default.aspx">second</a> among Direct Banks for highest customer satisfaction). Amid the accelerated pace of fraud in 2017, in July, Discover started <a href="https://investorrelations.discover.com/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/Discover-Offers-Free-Service-to-Alert-Cardmembers-If-Their-Social-Security-Numbers-Are-Found-on-Risky-Websites/default.aspx">offering a free service that monitors risky websites known to illegally sell or trade personal data</a> and alerts Discover cardmembers if their Social Security numbers are found with suspicious entities. In addition, Discover alerts cardmembers if any new credit cards, mortgages, car loans or other accounts are opened on their Experian credit report. These new alerts are aimed at helping Discover cardmembers protect themselves from identity theft or fraud.</p>

<p>Discover’s unique approach to partnership has not only allowed the network to grow rapidly, but has also put it in a position to help businesses around the world to offer more payments options, and, expand their customer bases. Discover’s connected network has made continuous gains when it comes to reach, acceptance and cardholder base.</p>

<h2 id="alipay-partners-with-poynt-to-provide-millions-of-chinese-travelers-with-seamless-payment-acceptance-on-smart-terminals-across-north-america">Alipay Partners with Poynt to Provide Millions of Chinese Travelers with Seamless Payment Acceptance on Smart Terminals Across North America</h2>

<p>Chinese payments giants are paving the highway into the US payments industry, and someone (namely, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and Android Pay) ought to get nervous. Alipay has resources and domestic experience to potentially dominate any market.</p>

<p>Operated by Ant Financial Services Group, Alipay is the world’s largest mobile and online payment platform. Launched in 2004, Alipay currently has over 520 million active users and over 200 domestic financial institution partners. Alipay has evolved from a digital wallet to a lifestyle enabler: users can hail a taxi, book a hotel, buy movie tickets, pay utility bills, make appointments with doctors, or purchase wealth management products directly from within the app.</p>

<p>In addition to online payments, Alipay is expanding to in-store offline payments both inside and outside of China. Over 10 million brick-and-mortar merchants now accept Alipay across China. Alipay’s in-store payment service covers more than 30 countries across the world, and tax reimbursement via Alipay is supported in 24 countries and regions. Alipay works with over 250 overseas financial institutions and payment solution providers to enable cross-border payments for Chinese traveling overseas and overseas customers who purchase products from Chinese e-commerce sites. Alipay currently supports 27 currencies.</p>

<p>“Alipay, one of the world’s leading digital payment platforms, has partnered with Poynt, the maker of the world’s first smart terminal, to enable Alipay’s more than 520 million registered users in China and beyond to pay with Alipay across all Poynt devices in North America.</p>

<p>Through the agreement, Alipay users visiting North America will enjoy a seamless, familiar checkout experience using the payment method that is most comfortable for them. Alipay is China’s leading online payment provider and the primary means of online and mobile payments for Chinese consumers.”</p>

<h2 id="north-american-bancard-brings-alipay-to-main-street-merchants">North American Bancard Brings Alipay to Main Street Merchants</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.nabancard.com/">North American Bancard</a> Holdings ($50 billion in payments processed for more than 310,000 businesses), a multi-faceted payment solutions provider, and Alipay announced that Alipay is now available on NAB’s wholly owned Electronic Payment Exchange (EPX) processing platform through a variety of NAB-owned products, including gateways, terminals and mobile payment solutions.</p>

<p>Now, US merchants of all sizes can benefit by offering Alipay as a payment type in their stores.</p>

<p>The number of Chinese consumers visiting North America is predicted to grow to four million this year. In addition, the Chinese middle class is presently the single fastest-growing online consumer market in the world, estimated to grow to 600 million by 2020, and North American merchants will be well-positioned with this customer base if they are able to accept the preferred payment type of this consumer demographic whether in-store or online.</p>

<p>“Through our strong partnership with NAB, over 120,000 of NAB’s PayAnywhere merchants are now enabled with Alipay which includes best-in-class support,” said Souheil Badran, President of Alipay North America.</p>

<p>Alipay is enabled on the EPX processing platform and will be accessible to independent software vendors (ISVs) wanting to integrate with the technology in December 2017. PayAnywhere users are able to use a camera, or barcode scanner, to accept Alipay through both the mobile app and PayAnywhere Storefront. By the end of 2017, Alipay acceptance will be rolled out to all of NAB’s semi-integrated MICROS terminals, along with their entire Ingenico terminal merchant base.</p>

<p>The taxi cabs in two popular US destinations have responded to the millions of Chinese tourists coming in every year. By next month, tens of thousands of cabs in New York City and Las Vegas will accept Alipay, China’s nearly ubiquitous mobile payment mode.</p>

<p>This will apply to 2,100 taxis in Vegas by the end of October before another 14,000 in New York start accepting Alipay payment in November.</p>

<p>Alipay started its crusade earlier. In October 2016, <a href="https://www.verifone.com/en/us/press-release/verifone-partners-alipay">Alipay partnered with Verifone</a>, a world leader in payment and commerce solutions, to enable retailers in North America and Europe.</p>

<p>Using an mPOS solution to accept Alipay App payments at their stores, retailers can increase brand visibility, and drive traffic and sales through Alipay’s in-app marketing tool. With the Verifone e355 mPOS solution, retailers will be able to accept Alipay anywhere in the store and implement marketing campaigns targeting Chinese consumers who use the Alipay app.</p>

According to the latest report from FT Partners, banking (including P2P lending), and payments scored the most deals in the period. With innovation in facilitating convenient banking services, comes ever-accelerating fraud risk and a considerate cost at which security breaches come to companies. No wonder forward-thinking teams continue to secure financial support for advanced security solutions, and payments behemoths continue an aggressive push to make payments convenient.</p>

<h2 id="feedzai-closes-50m-series-c-to-help-banks-and-merchants-identify-fraud-with-ai">Feedzai closes $50M Series C to help banks and merchants identify fraud with AI</h2>

<p>On October 17, 2017, Feedzai announced it has raised $50 million in its Series C financing round from an undisclosed investor with participation from existing investor Sapphire Ventures.</p>

<p>This new funding brings the total venture capital raised to $82 million from nine major investors, including Oak HC/FT, Capital One Growth Ventures, Citi Ventures and more.</p>

<p>Founded in 2009 and headquartered in San Mateo, CA, Feedzai is a leader in using artificial intelligence to empower enterprises to manage risk and fight fraud in real-time Feedzai’s machine learning technology and its omnichannel fraud prevention solutions serve customers that transact in virtually every country in the world, across numerous use cases for leading banks and merchants.</p>

<p>“Until now, banks have used solutions based on verticals,” Nuno Sebastiao, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Feedzai, said to TechCrunch in an interview. “The fraud solution you have for an ATM wouldn’t be the same fraud solution you would use for online banking which wouldn’t be the same fraud solution would have for a voice call center.”</p>

<h2 id="paypal-rolls-out-venmo-payments-to-its-us-retailers">PayPal rolls out Venmo payments to its US retailers</h2>

<p>This was due for a while. Now, Venmo users can pay at all online locations that accept PayPal – Pay with Venmo becomes ubiquitous. Also, every merchant that has Braintree’s payment gateway can enable Venmo. Suddenly, everyone from Forever 21, online sellers, to charities and hundreds of apps will have millennials paying via Venmo now. Over 2 million online US retailers can now accept Pay with Venmo.</p>

<p>The genius of the Braintree acquisition is also fully apparent now.</p>

<p>This underscores the growing need to nail merchant payments. As P2P payments had been a big focus on the past with Venmo, merchant payments will be the big focus in next few years.</p>

<p>Not to forget, there’s also PayPal’s consumer purchase protection. The ability to split bills later on Venmo and every transaction shared on Venmo, which doubles up as a payments social network of sorts, is beautiful.</p>

<p>IBM Security and Ponemon Institute are pleased to release the 2017 Cost of Data Breach Study: Global Overview. According to the whitepaper, the average total cost of data breach decreased from $4 million to $3.62 million. The average cost for each lost or stolen record containing sensitive and confidential information also significantly decreased from $158 in 2016 to $141 in this year’s study. However, despite the decline in the overall cost, companies in this year’s study are having larger breaches. The average size of the data breaches in this research increased 1.8%.</p>

<p>The average per capita cost of a data breach was $225 in the United States and $190 in Canada. The lowest cost was Brazil ($79) and India ($64). The average total organizational cost in the United States was $7.35 million and $4.94 million in the Middle East. The lowest average total organizational cost was in Brazil ($1.52 million) and India ($1.68 million).</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>The issues related to scaling new technology, specifically in terms of stress testing its availability and redundancy, are very well known to entities that successfully operate such products and services at scale. While this is a tried and tested field, and hence, has proven tools and methodologies; the factors that typically trip up most providers can eventually be traced back to user behavior. What the inventor would classify as an outlier or erratic behavior in a lighthouse customer may turn out to be its Achilles heel.</p>

<p>Beyond the technological considerations are the relatively more challenging issues related to constructing and refining the business model.</p>

<p>Will this be a free service or paid subscription or something in-between? If this is free to the consumer, how will the provider recover their startup investments and sustain ongoing operations? If there is an ecosystem that is required to support the new product and service, what are the economics for the entire value-chain to ensure viability and sustainability over time? Which providers pay into the ecosystem and which providers are paid out by the ecosystem? If the consumer is required to pay for something, either at the onset or on an ongoing basis, what is the tipping point on the value-for-money scale? If the product or service is priced too aggressively on launch, is there any coming back from the dead? If the product or service is priced too complacently on introduction, is it possible to raise the price over time?</p>

<p>For every new idea that holds up on the technology front as it is systematically scaled, just a fraction successfully figure out the business model test, and an even smaller fraction survive the arduous journey of commercial sustainability. For the very select few that are still standing at the end of these three rounds, they now qualify to face a very different opponent.</p>

<p>In the blue corner, we have our shiny new gizmo; and in the red corner, are the regulators.</p>

<p>Regulators have the most unenviable task of ensuring that consumers are never in a state of jeopardy and that the entire ecosystem plays fairly with the consumer as well as with each other. The very nature of their responsibility forces them into the red corner. If they were to ease up on their conservative stance, it would be close to impossible to govern even the simplest of offerings for a niche industry, let alone a complex solution for the mass market.</p>

<p>Assuming we have figured out a new product or service that can deliver recurring and sustainable value to the consumer, and also to the entire enabling ecosystem, we now have our progression for successfully achieving scale. Start with overcoming the technological challenges, then iron out business model quirks, and finally satisfy regulatory demands.</p>

<p>The devil is always in the detail and someone has to be the devil’s advocate.</p>

<p>The industry progression for secure mobile transactions is to start with m-commerce, then scale or diversify to m-payments, and then finally evolve m-transactions. While some of the early m-commerce wins are now starting to scale, it is too soon to judge m-payments, let alone m-transactions. Clearly, the considerations for conducting two transactions a month versus 10 a day are going to be very different.</p>

<p>An early win for the former does not guarantee scale for the latter.</p>

                    <p>Which cities and governments are ahead of the world in adopting digital money, and why is it important? Today’s top picks offer comprehensive answers.</p>

<h2 id="cashless-cities-realizing-the-benefits-of-digital-payments">Cashless Cities: Realizing the Benefits of Digital Payments</h2>

<p>Cities account for a large proportion of the global population and its economic activity. Today, over half of the world’s population lives in cities. By 2050, this number will increase to two-thirds. Currently, over 80% of global economic activity takes place in cities and it is expected that the vast majority of future economic growth will come from cities.</p>

<p>A study by Visa estimates that among other benefits, increasing digital payments across the 100 cities could result in total direct net benefits of $470 billion per year.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/A1-4beca0.png" alt="A1-4beca0.png" /></p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/visa-everywhere/documents/visa-cashless-cities-report.pdf?utm_content=buffer53211&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">Cashless Cities: Realizing the Benefits of Digital Payments</a>, Visa</p>

<p>The study found that consumers across the 100 cities currently spend an average of 32 hours a year on cash-related payment activities. Greater adoption of digital payments is estimated to reduce this figure to 24 hours a year. When other benefits of digital payments are taken into account, such as reduction in cash-related crime, these savings could increase to $278 million per city, equivalent to about $67 per adult per year.</p>

<p>Accepting cash and checks costs businesses about 7% of every dollar received compared to 5% for every dollar collected from digital sources. A study projects that when combining savings with increased sales from digital payments usage, the total net benefits to businesses across all 100 cities could amount to over $312 billion per year after transitioning to an achievable level of cashless activity.</p>

<p>Average annual savings to governments in direct administrative expenditures by making greater use of digital payments amount to $710 million. A reduction in cash-related crime could save an additional $53 million per year. Meanwhile, the estimated potential increase in tax revenue from digital payment adoption amounts to an average of $534 million per year.</p>

<h2 id="the-march-towards-digital-money-digital-money-index-2017">The March Towards Digital Money (Digital Money Index 2017)</h2>

<p>As made apparent by the previous study, the adoption of digital money has tangible benefits for governments, businesses and consumers alike. To understand these opportunities, Citi and Imperial College London developed a Digital Money Index.</p>

<p>The report called “<a href="https://www.citibank.com/icg/sa/digital_symposium/digital_money_index/pdf/DMI_report_2017.pdf">The March Towards Digital Money: Bringing the Underbanked in From the Cold</a>” emphasizes that digital money adoption can transform economies. It can make payments faster, cheaper, safer and more transparent. Digital Money can create opportunities for greater economic participation and more efficient commerce. It matters in principle, and it matters in practice. A 10% increase in digital money adoption would allow 220 million people to enter the formal financial sector. It can combat corruption and make flows of money more transparent – including $1 trillion of new flows in the formal economy. And it can increase tax revenues, potentially by as much as $100 billion.</p>

<h2 id="venmo-now-accepted-at-millions-of-retailers">Venmo Now Accepted at Millions of Retailers</h2>

<p>In a major step forward in the evolution of Venmo, PayPal announced that starting this week, Venmo customers can use their Venmo account to shop and make purchases on their mobile phone at more than 2 million US retailers, almost everywhere PayPal is accepted.</p>

<p>“The investments we’ve made in our platform architecture allow us to enable Venmo as a payment method for millions of PayPal merchants at one time without any additional integration work on the merchant’s part, mirroring the approach we used to successfully launch <a href="https://www.paypal.com/stories/us/paypal-mobile-leadership-extends">One Touch</a>.</p>

<p>We’re also <a href="http://braintreepayments.com/blog/expanding-venmos-commerce-offerings">expanding</a> the ways that merchants can accept Venmo on the Braintree platform with the introduction of mobile web payment support. Now, Braintree merchants can offer Venmo as a payment option both in-app and on mobile web. And as part of our continuous innovation, we’re testing the ability for merchants to offer dynamically-painted payment buttons, which will show Venmo customers a custom dual-branded button that allows selection between PayPal or Venmo payment options.”</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence, especially machine learning, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/applying-ai-for-a-better-tomorrow/">will overhaul big industries</a>, including manufacturing, finance, and healthcare, potentially adding up to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/how-artificial-intelligence-can-deliver-real-value-to-companies">$126 billion</a> to the US economy by 2025. June 2017 McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/how-artificial-intelligence-can-deliver-real-value-to-companies">report</a> emphasizes that digital-native firms such as <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/ai-and-neuroscience-virtuous-circle/">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-baidu-will-win-chinas-ai-raceand-maybe-the-worlds/">Baidu</a> are betting vast amounts of money on AI – between $20 billion and $30 billion in 2016, including significant M&amp;A activity. Baidu is in partnership with the government to build the country’s first national AI research laboratory in Beijing. The company increased its R&amp;D spending to $464 million from April to July this year, 28% more than in the same period a year ago, according to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3bd8dc72-7c0a-11e7-9108-edda0bcbc928?mhq5j=e6">FT</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike humans, aging has a positive effect on AI. McKinsey concludes that advances in the speed of GPUs have enabled the training speed of deep learning systems to improve five or six times over in each of the last two years.</p>

<p>“More data – the world creates about 2.2 exabytes of it every day – translates into more insights and higher accuracy because it exposes algorithms to more examples they can use to identify correct and reject incorrect answers. Machine learning systems enabled by these torrents of data have reduced computer error rates in some applications – for example, in image identification – to about the same as the rate for humans.”</p>

<h2 id="automated-automation">Automated automation</h2>

<p>AML does not stand for “anti-money laundering”; it stands for “automated machine learning.”</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastianraschka/">Sebastian Raschka</a>, a Ph.D. student at Michigan State University, <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/01/current-state-automated-machine-learning.html">describes</a>, “if computer programming is about automation, and machine learning is “all about automating automation,” automated machine learning is “the automation of automating automation.” Programming relieves us by managing rote tasks; machine learning allows computers to learn how to best perform these rote tasks; automated machine learning allows for computers to learn how to optimize the outcome of learning how to perform these rote actions.</p>

<p>“This is a very powerful idea; while we previously have had to worry about tuning parameters and hyperparameters, automated machine learning systems can learn the best way to tune these for optimal outcomes by a number of different possible methods.”</p>

<p>While not new, the idea finds application in a range of high-profile projects. In May 2017, <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/google-is-improving-its-artificial-intelligence-with-artificial-intelligence">Google unveiled a new approach to machine learning</a> where neural networks are used to build better neural networks. Google designed its AutoML project to be an artificial intelligence that could help humans create other, more powerful, efficient systems than human engineers can. Google research suggests that AutoML might be smarter at recognizing the best approaches to solving a problem than the human experts.</p>

<p>Tom Simonite, MIT Technology Review San Francisco bureau chief, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603381/ai-software-learns-to-make-ai-software/?set=603387">shares</a> that in one experiment, researchers at the Google Brain artificial intelligence research group had software design a machine-learning system to take a test used to benchmark software that processes language. What it came up with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">surpassed previously published results</a> from software designed by humans.</p>

<p>In 2002, the idea of getting machines to effectively teach machines resonated with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-achin-b425583a/">Jeremy Achin</a>, data scientist and the CEO of <a href="https://www.datarobot.com/">DataRobot</a>. Achin saw an opportunity to automate machine learning while taking part in data-science competitions on the crowdsourcing platform <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/google-is-acquiring-data-science-community-kaggle/">acquired by Google</a>), which offered prizes for the algorithm that performs best at making a specific prediction from a large data set. One of the best early Kaggle contestants, Achin, realized he was already automating a lot of the steps involved in each competition. “I thought that if we collected enough data sets, enough problems, and ran enough experiments, we could do machine learning on machine learning. That was the original idea,” <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608921/ai-algorithms-are-starting-to-teach-ai-algorithms/">Achin shared with Will Knight, MIT Technology Review</a>.</p>

<p>Airbnb was an unexpected find in research on automated machine learning applications/projects. “We have found AML tools to be most useful for regression and classification problems involving tabular datasets; however, the state of this area is quickly advancing. In summary, we believe that in certain cases AML can vastly increase a data scientist’s productivity, often by an order of magnitude,” <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/automated-machine-learning-a-paradigm-shift-that-accelerates-data-scientist-productivity-airbnb-f1f8a10d61f8">says</a> Hamel Husain, a Data Scientist at Airbnb. Husain shares that the company has leveraged AML for following tasks:</p>

<p>Benchmarking</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unbiased presentation of challenger models: AML can quickly present a plethora of challenger models using the same training set as your incumbent model. This can aid the data scientist in choosing the best model family.</li>
</ul>

<p>Diagnostics &amp; exploration</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Detecting Target Leakage: Because AML builds candidate models extremely fast in an automated way, we can detect data leakage earlier in the modeling life cycle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Diagnostics: As mentioned earlier, canonical diagnostics can be automatically generated such as learning curves, partial dependence plots, feature importance, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Automation</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tasks like exploratory data analysis, pre-processing of data, hyper-parameter tuning, model selection and putting models into production can be automated to some extent with an automated machine learning framework.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other interesting <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3226468/machine-learning/6-machine-learning-projects-to-automate-machine-learning.html">examples</a> of automated machine learning tools include <a href="https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/stable/">auto-sklearn</a>, <a href="https://rhiever.github.io/tpot/">TPOT</a> (a Python automated machine learning tool), and more.</p>

<h2 id="self-taught-ai-is-a-more-accessible-ai">Self-taught AI is a more accessible AI</h2>

<p>Whether there is <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608573/andrew-ngs-next-trick-training-a-million-ai-experts/">one AI expert</a> or million, talent shortage will inevitably stagnate AI capabilities and adoption. AI proliferation without human factor constraint would mean systems being able to produce other, more efficient and powerful systems. “The goal is to make this technology more accessible,” <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608921/ai-algorithms-are-starting-to-teach-ai-algorithms/">says</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johngiannandrea/">John Giannandrea</a>, SVP of Engineering at Google who leads Google’s AI efforts. “So anybody could say ‘build me a predictive model’ and it goes off and does it.”</p>

<p>“If self-starting AI techniques become practical, they could increase the pace at which machine-learning software is implemented across the economy. Companies must currently pay a premium for machine-learning experts, who are in short supply,” <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603381/ai-software-learns-to-make-ai-software/?set=603387">emphasizes</a> Simonite.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>If the history of FinTech teaches us something, it’s that unexpected things happen. Seemingly successful cases meet speed bumps, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/lending-club-saga-from-a-different-point-of-view-for-the-larger-good/">pivoting the history of the whole segment</a>. Today’s picks are dedicated to that – to the ups and downs of remarkable businesses and technologies.</p>

<h2 id="square-has-just-begun-its-ascent-with-loans-and-high-tech">Square Has Just Begun Its Ascent With Loans and High Tech</h2>

<p>Square, being one of the most remarkable success stories in FinTech, is on the fast track to becoming an influential institution of the new age. After all, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/08/dear-silicon-valley-americas-fallen-out-of-love-with-you/">Silicon Valley is the Wall Street of 2017</a>. Square will likely be a rare case of a startup that managed to <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/secret-of-success-in-fintech-partner-merge-acquire/">build its way into niche markets</a>, starting with <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/overview-of-the-payments-industry/">payments</a>, and now – lending.</p>

<h3 id="star-of-the-show--loan-automation">Star of the Show – Loan Automation</h3>

<p>While Square started as a payments service, its expansion into loans is a big attraction for investors. JPMorgan sees Square Capital as the most profitable value-added service in the Square empire. The client onboarding services are fully automated, and Jack Dorsey reported that 99.95% of loan applications get decided automatically by the system.</p>

<p>The average loan size is small at $6,000 but the portfolio loss size is respectable at 4%. The World Bank sets the acceptable microloan loss rate at 5% globally. For small businesses that rely on its payments and POS services, Square has a strong database to access the credibility of its retail business borrower which it enhances its predictive ability with machine learning and data analytics. Such technology can even extend to consumer loans in the near future.</p>

<h2 id="ripple--the-gates-foundation-team-up-to-level-the-economic-playing-field-for-the-poor">Ripple &amp; the Gates Foundation Team Up to Level the Economic Playing Field for the Poor</h2>

<p>Big news – new open-source software called Mojaloop for creating a real-time, interoperable payments platform on a national scale to reach the world’s poor with essential financial tools.</p>

<h3 id="a-new-interoperable-system-to-bring-the-poor-into-the-global-economy">A New Interoperable System to Bring the Poor into the Global Economy</h3>

<p>Leveraging the power of the <a href="https://medium.com/@justmoon/the-subtle-tyranny-of-blockchain-91d98b8a3a65">Interledger Protocol (ILP)</a>, Mojaloop offers a way for financial providers, governments and mobile network operators to simplify and reduce the cost of developing inclusive payments platforms.</p>

<p>Mojaloop can be used to connect customers, merchants, banks, providers and government offices across a country’s economy – accelerating progress toward a truly inclusive economy.</p>

<p>The new software is a boon for the 90% of the world’s poor that don’t have bank accounts and are covered by different mobile signals.</p>

<p>Now, individuals in developing markets can send and receive payments on any Level One-enabled payment system and store the funds in a mobile wallet.</p>

<h2 id="sofi-withdraws-us-banking-application-citing-leadership-change">SoFi Withdraws US Banking Application, Citing Leadership Change</h2>

<p>US digital lending FinTechs seem to always get into trouble – because of internal troubles, players are hurting themselves as well as the market one after the other. After Lending Club and Prosper, it’s SoFi now.</p>

<h3 id="the-company-is-facing-sexual-harassment-lawsuits">The company is facing sexual harassment lawsuits.</h3>

<p>Student online lender Social Finance said on Friday that it is withdrawing its application for a bank license in the wake of the departure of a number of senior executives, including Co-founder &amp; former CEO Mike Cagney.</p>

<p>“A bank charter remains an attractive option when the time is right. This decision does not change our plans to make deposit accounts available through partner banks in the near future.”</p>

<p>Earlier this month, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters said that Cagney’s departure in September had complicated SoFi’s banking application because regulators assess whether a company has a capable CEO before allowing it to accept deposits.</p>

<p>SoFi is one of the most valuable private financial technology startups in the United States and was valued at over $4 billion in its last funding round.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <h2 id="how-many-fintech-startups-does-it-take-to-create-one-comprehensive-payment-solution">How many FinTech startups does it take to create one comprehensive payment solution?</h2>

<p>Apparently, close to <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/">1.5K</a>. That is how many FinTech startups are operating in the payments segment – <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/global-fintech-funding-36-bn-2016/">one of the most represented and well-funded segments in FinTech</a> (along with lending). Let’s see why.</p>

<h2 id="the-most-meaningful-competition-in-fintech-jumps-to-a-whole-new-level">The most meaningful competition in FinTech jumps to a whole new level</h2>

<p>There are two main levels of competition in FinTech – the first one for survival (which happens within FinTech), and the next one for cross-niche leadership (in the ‘real world’, where grownups like Amazon and Apple operate).</p>

<p>The first one is pretty trivial; the vast majority of <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/">FinTech startups around the world</a> are competing for capital, traction, and an extended runway before the next round. More importantly, on that level, the only competition that matters is with fellow startups. Whether there are 1.5K FinTech startups building some sort of a payments solution, or there are 5K doing the same, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/7k-fintech-startups-globally-will-fall-victim-to-consolidation-in-finserv/">only a handful have a resemblance of a chance in an intensely competitive market</a>.</p>

<p>The next level is far more interesting. Few that scored the most funding, forged the most <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/secret-of-success-in-fintech-partner-merge-acquire/">powerful alliances</a>, and built truly superior to peers solutions, all the while <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/25-fintech-startups-that-expanded-globally-despite-regulations-other-problems/">crossing international borders</a>, enter an aggressive race for cross-niche dominance. And in that game, survivors compete with a vast array of players coming from diverse backgrounds, often times with true heavyweights that existed before FinTech became a ‘thing’, like IBM, Amazon, Alibaba, etc.</p>

<h3 id="commerce-and-payments-will-lead-to-lending">Commerce and payments will lead to lending</h3>

<p>Let’s look at a few interesting examples starting with Square, a well-known player that went from trading for $9 a share in 2015 to $33 in 2017. The company has grown its revenue from $850 million in 2014 to $1.7 billion in 2016, considerably shrinking losses between 2014 and 2016.</p>

<p>Square, however, did not stop on its initial segment, expanding its business into lending with <a href="https://squareup.com/capital">Square Capital</a> in May 2014. By August 2015, in a little over than a year, Square was advancing <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/08/05/square-capital-is-advancing-1-million-per-day-to-small-businesses/">$1 million</a> per day to businesses and has disbursed a total of $225 million (up from $100 million early 2015) in cash advances to more than 20,000 small businesses. By November 2016, Square Capital has lent <a href="https://squareup.com/townsquare/square-capital-1-billion-in-funding-to-over-100k-sellers">$1 billion</a> in cash advances and loans to more than 100,000 businesses.</p>

<p>It’s curious that payments space is the one often seen spreading hands into other niches. “<em>There are some tectonic shifts going on, driven by tech and the geopolitical environment,”</em> Barclays Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-14/barclays-ceo-says-bank-must-ward-off-apple-amazon-in-payments">said</a> during a panel discussion at the annual meeting of the Institute of International Finance (<a href="https://www.iif.com/">IIF</a>) in Washington. “<em>All the banks are very focused on the payments space. That may be where the battleground of finance is fought over the next 15 years.”</em></p>

<p>Furthermore, companies succeeding in the payments segment, start creating closed ecosystems through expansion into HR services, consumer and business lending, accounting, and more. The natural step then is to apply for a bank license, or, like in a sneaky case with Square, for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/square-will-apply-for-an-industrial-loan-company-license-this-week/">an industrial loan company license</a>. Large commerce players follow the same path.</p>

<p>Two years ago, Alibaba’s financial arm Ant Financial entered Chinese banking business with the <a href="https://qz.com/436889/alibabas-customers-can-now-get-a-loan-based-on-their-online-shopping-history/">launch of Mybank</a>, an Internet-only bank for customers and small businesses. In 2015, Alibaba <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2015/02/03/alibaba-to-offer-loans-to-u-s-businesses-through-lending-club/#53a0d8cf7baf">started offering loans to US businesses through Lending Club</a>, allowing US-based businesses to apply for short-term credit of up to $300,000 to buy from China-based suppliers. Monthly interest rates ranged from 0.5% to 2.4%.</p>

<p>“We know and value Swift’s technology platform and people, and we believe their talent and capabilities will further strengthen our overall merchant value proposition,” PayPal’s Darrell Esch wrote in announcing the deal. “Building upon an existing commercial relationship, the acquisition of Swift Financial will enable us to better serve small businesses by enhancing our underwriting capabilities to provide access to affordable business financing solutions to more businesses to help them grow and thrive.” PayPal’s Darrell Esch wrote in announcing the deal. “Building upon an existing commercial relationship, the acquisition of Swift Financial will enable us to better serve small businesses by enhancing our underwriting capabilities to provide access to affordable business financing solutions to more businesses to help them grow and thrive.”</p>

<p>A 22-year-old giant Amazon isn’t missing out on any sort of business either. E-commerce is far from being its most-known area of expertise – <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/16/amazon-plans-to-crush-small-business-lending.html">another industry Amazon plans to crush is small business lending</a>. Some even <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/16/amazon-plans-to-crush-small-business-lending.html">suggest</a> that Amazon’s entry into small-business lending could transform the banking industry in the same way that the web-based retailer revolutionized retail.</p>

<p>Between June 2016 and June 2017, Amazon was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-loans/amazon-lent-1-billion-to-merchants-to-boost-sales-on-its-marketplace-idUSKBN18Z0DY">reported</a> to have lent out &gt;$1 billion in small loans to sellers, compared with &gt;$1.5 billion it lent in a four-year period from 2011 through 2015. More than 20,000 small businesses have received a loan from Amazon with &gt;50% of the companies eventually taking a second loan from the company. Since Amazon Lending launched in 2011, it has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/16/amazon-plans-to-crush-small-business-lending.html">surpassed $3 billion in loans to small businesses</a>.</p>

<p>Silicon Valley payments company Stripe, valued at <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/11/25/payments-stripe-valuation/">$9 billion</a>, is another important and interesting example. Back in August 2013, <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/8/prweb11041884.htm">Stripe got in bed with an online business lender Kabbage</a> to allow Kabbage to underwrite loans based on exclusively Stripe payment processing data. In an outstandingly smart move, Stripe created an opportunity for itself to understand the use of its data for lending purposes. It’s a model that hasn’t been much explored before and a very important one. By 2017, Stripe forged a set of similar <a href="https://stripe.com/works-with/categories/financing">partnerships</a> – with <a href="https://www.iwoca.co.uk/stripe/">iwoca</a>, <a href="https://loans.gane.io/">Gane Loans</a>, <a href="https://www.socketapp.com/integrations/">Socket</a>, <a href="https://www.crowdvalley.com/">Crowd Valley</a>, <a href="https://clearbanc.com/demo/analytics">Clearbanc</a>, and <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/us/ref/partner/560dc2aa646332001f1b0000/stripe">Funding Circle</a> – in which each partner gains ‘privileges’ and can offer benefits to potential borrowers who are on the hook with Stripe services. Stripe data is at the center of its outsourced lending business.</p>

<p>At the end of this summer, global payments processor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/paypal-acquires-swift-financial/">PayPal announced it will acquire Swift Financial</a>, a US-based small business lending platform. For PayPal, the acquisition is expected to bolster a portion of the company’s business that has seen increased competition over the years. It first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/22/paypal-working-capital-uk/">launched a Working Capital product</a> for businesses back in 2013 (which between 2013 and 2016 provided <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/smallbusiness/article-3391951/PayPal-s-lending-arm-plays-ball-60-000-companies-providing-690m.html">£690 million</a> to small firms), and since then has seen competitors like Square and Kabbage emerge as offering their own credit lines to small business customers, TechCrunch reports. PayPal has acquired Swift to add to its own underwriting capabilities and expand the amount of data it can use to assess the creditworthiness of its customers. Doing so should expand the amount of capital it makes available.</p>

<p>“We know and value Swift’s technology platform and people, and we believe their talent and capabilities will further strengthen our overall merchant value proposition,” PayPal’s Darrell Esch wrote in announcing the deal. “Building upon an existing commercial relationship, the acquisition of Swift Financial will enable us to better serve small businesses by enhancing our underwriting capabilities to provide access to affordable business financing solutions to more businesses to help them grow and thrive.” PayPal’s Darrell Esch wrote in announcing the deal. “<em>Building upon an existing commercial relationship, the acquisition of Swift Financial will enable us to better serve small businesses by enhancing our underwriting capabilities to provide access to affordable business financing solutions to more businesses to help them grow and thrive.”</em></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Lust is on the second circle of hell indeed. For FinTech, it’s lust for cross-niche expansion and desire to create closed ecosystems behind the doors of their close partnerships. A single-segment leadership is no longer a viable strategy for sustainable growth. Companies that are able to address the needs of their customers comprehensively will have an upper hand in establishing market leadership. And it appears that payments and commerce players are the ones most greedy to expand their portfolio of financial products in the nearest future.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>McDonald’s, globally one of the most visible brands, has more than 36,000 restaurants in 120 countries and revenues of more than $24 billion. While we may ridicule the gastronomical sophistication of their menu and debate the nutritional value of their quarter pounder with cheese, there is no denying the fact that it is one of the world’s most popular fast food destinations. About 70 million people attest to that every single day.</p>

<p>One can only start to imagine the complexities involved in ensuring that something as trivial as what the Americans call French fries, or chips as the English prefer, can be made and served consistently to millions of hungry patrons. If that were not difficult enough, add the compounded complexity of doing this in Des Plaines, Helsinki, Moscow, Istanbul, Durban, Riyadh, Chennai, Shenzhen, Hobart, and Rio de Janeiro – every single day.</p>

<p>To ensure consistency in taste, which is what their customers care about, as well as maintaining the highest standards of quality and food safety, which is what regulators are more concerned about, McDonald’s has invested billions of dollars over the years to develop the necessary know-how, equipment, processes, logistics, training and support. In some countries, McDonald’s has had to get vertically integrated across their supply chain, setting up contract farms to ensure consistency in the quality of the produce they source on a daily basis.</p>

<p>As technocrats, we take tremendous pride in inventing things. Assuming we have truly stumbled upon the next best thing after sliced bread, the process of conceiving the idea, drawing it up on the whiteboard, filing a patent, building a prototype, and finding like-minded technocrats to try our gizmo out, is extremely satisfying.</p>

<p>In most instances, the extremely difficult next step of taking our prized gizmo to a broader audience, or going from prototype to pilot to launch, requires a larger ecosystem. At a bare minimum, it needs someone that is already operating at scale, with a captive audience that goes significantly further than the proverbial early adopters, and most importantly, can dictate some amount of trust so potential end users are relatively more comfortable taking the leap of faith. All the critical factors of success, when it comes to scaling a new product or service, can be distilled down to this leap of faith.</p>

<p>The faith in the technology, as in it will perform exactly the way it is touted, every single time and under all circumstances. The faith in its availability, as in it will perform exactly the way it is touted, once lots of people start using it, under all circumstances, and at the same time. The faith in its redundancy, as in it will perform exactly the way it is touted, once lots of people start using it, under all circumstances, at the same time, when something beyond its control goes wrong, and its backup kicks in seamlessly without making the switch obvious to the end-user in any way.</p>

<p>For disciples of scale, visiting Hamburger University on McDonald’s Oak Brook campus is like a pilgrimage.</p>

<p>So what does McDonald’s have to do with delivering sustainable secure m-transactions for consumers across diverse demographics and across disparate markets around the world?</p>

<p>Everything, if we want to start understanding the considerations and challenges associated with scale.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Depending on your perspective and predisposition, the future of FinTech is exciting and terrifying for the exact same reason: change. Incumbents, FinTechs, and tech giants like Amazon, Apple &amp; Google are relying on new technology to lead consumers and businesses to a new era of financial services. Will it happen? Yes. However, we seem to focus a lot on the technology. Ask yourself what the top words that come to mind are when you think of FinTech. I’d imagine it’s something like blockchain, AI, ML, cloud, UX/CX, robo-advisors, digitization, and mobile-first. It’s as if the tech is the evolution. It’s not – at least not for financial services. The “tech” in FinTech only has to be leveraged in the right way to make a difference to customers. That’s it. That’s the only requirement. For that matter, it doesn’t even have to be cutting-edge, new tech – at least not for most customers. Evolution is about survival, nothing more or less. That’s what makes FinTech so exciting (and terrifying) – everyone has a singular mission: to be a part of the future. Today, we look at two very different futures in FinTech from last week:</p>

<h2 id="the-secret-of-success-in-fintech-partner-merge-acquire">The Secret of Success in FinTech: Partner, Merge, Acquire</h2>

<p>“FinTech is not a disruptive force (and <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/45-plus-use-cases-for-blockchain-technology/">blockchain is not a disruptive technology</a>). Rather, it’s the history of institutional banking repeating itself. And the further into 2017, the more apparent it is that the global market is extremely limited for <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/">~8K FinTech startups</a> to have a sustainable future altogether. In the years ahead, the success denominator in FinTech will be its scale. Only the ones able to score powerful partnerships will step into the next phase of development – institutionalization, which is a short track to becoming another financial institution and the very same type of organization tech entrepreneurs are now so passionate to call obsolete.”</p>

<p>Financial services are not new. The sheer complexity of doing business within the current infrastructure makes survival acutely difficult. The quick shift from “FinTechs are the future, banks are doomed” to “FinTech + bank partnerships are the future” is not mere coincidence. Technology has created a lot of new industries in the last 20-30 years but FinServ isn’t one of them (at least not yet – see the next article). Partner, merge, acquire is the survival playbook for FinTech. Very few can and will forge their own lineage.</p>

<p>Regardless of your personal feelings on Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, this tweet is something to think about – true or not. About 10 years ago, this idea wasn’t even possible. Now, depending on where you live in the world, you can buy almost anything with Bitcoin (<a href="https://qz.com/878728/buy-and-hodl-just-dont-get-rekt-the-slang-that-gets-you-taken-seriously-as-a-bitcoin-trader/">or just hodl it</a>). It’s proof that a parallel system to store and transfer value is here and viable. Will Bitcoin survive? Maybe. That’s not the point. The crypto-cat is out of the bag. It’s not as easy to use or as fast as Visa, PayPal, AmEx, or any traditional banking system. However, it’s got a large network; it’s good enough, and it’s decentralized. Those are decent odds for survival.</p>

<p>P.S. How many of you are wishing you had been investing in Bitcoin since 2010?</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>The choice was difficult today – talented people are tireless in enriching the pool of knowledge for the community of finance and tech professionals. On the other hand, the Internet age doesn’t make it easy to pick out read-worthy pieces.</p>

<h2 id="you-cannot-buy-experience-online">You cannot buy experience online.</h2>

<p>The first one to catch my attention was a curious piece about the transformation of physical spaces under the influence of the digital world; particularly, how shopping malls became a leisure space rather than what they were intended to be – a shopping space. China is a vivid example of how brick-and-mortar retail will have to change to cut it in the e-commerce-driven world. “The lifestyle center evolution” – a perfect description of what is happening with retail.</p>

<h2 id="pick-1-how-chinas-shopping-malls-survive-and-thrive-in-the-e-commerce-age--forbes">Pick #1: How China’s Shopping Malls Survive and Thrive In The E-Commerce Age – Forbes</h2>

<p>“The traditional shopping mall isn’t really cutting it anymore in China,” said Warner Brown of JLL. “Department store and shopping mall landlords all know that they need to start focusing on their tenant mix or the products that are on offer, more on things that people can’t buy online: experience.”</p>

<p>According to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, 15.5% of all retail sales, amounting to $752 billion ($610 billion tangible goods), were transacted online last year — up 26.2% year-on-year. Over 500 million people reportedly engaged in online shopping in China in 2016, and it’s becoming normal for even fast-moving consumer goods, like toothpaste, to be bought online. By 2020, it is estimated that e-commerce sales in China will surpass those of the USA, UK, Japan, Germany, and France combined. In this fray, traditional shopping centers clearly need to evolve or go extinct.</p>

<p>“‘Lifestyle centers’ really started getting some airtime around 2014 when ‘pioneering’ centers launched, such as Suzhou Village, which combined art and retail in a thoughtfully crafted Italian setting, Shanghai’s IAPM, which isn’t unlike New York’s Guggenheim inside, and Chengdu’s Global Centre bundling shops with a 300 meter-long indoor beach in the world’s biggest building,” explained Mark Tanner of China Skinny, a Shanghai-based consumer research firm.</p>

<p>The next few picks of curious knowledge aggregations are FinTech-focused.</p>

<p>I like Knowledge@Wharton, as, I am sure, many do. One of the latest articles was particularly inspiring, voting in favor of collaborative innovation. It’s no secret anymore that <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/secret-of-success-in-fintech-partner-merge-acquire/">competition won’t cut it in the financial services industry</a>. “Competition has been shown to be useful up to a certain point and no further, but cooperation, which is the thing we must strive for today, begins where competition leaves off.” – FDR.</p>

<p>Indeed, a wave of cooperative initiatives traverses over the financial world – between <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freddie-mac-announces-collaboration-earnup-140000581.html">banks/financial institutions and startups</a>, startups and other startups, governments and startups, etc. It became clear that the <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/collaboration-will-drive-the-next-wave-of-innovation/">collaboration will drive the next wave of innovation</a>, and the article on Knowledge@Wharton makes a convincing, example-rich case.</p>

<h2 id="pick-2-why-the-next-phase-for-fintech-is-collaboration-not-just-competition--knowledgewharton">Pick #2: Why the Next Phase for FinTech Is Collaboration, Not Just Competition – Knowledge@Wharton</h2>

<p>FinTech — or financial technology — is a much-hyped buzzword on Wall Street that brings to mind nimble startups slaying stodgy bank ‘dinosaurs.’ The reality is more complicated. FinTech is growing up: Financial institutions are increasingly viewing these disruptors as partners while startups are learning that they need the scale and regulatory expertise of the incumbents.</p>

<p>“We are actively seeking startups for our members to partner with,” said Robert Nichols, president of the nearly 6,000-member American Banking Association (ABA). He said the ABA has “kicked the tires” of some startups to try to match them with banks, and it has invited five disruptors to present at its annual convention, to be held this month in Chicago. The ABA also created a ‘FinTech playbook’ designed for smaller banks. Collaboration is a good thing. “The banks have trusted relationships, these [startups] have ideas to enhance the customer experience,” said Nichols in a follow-up interview with Knowledge@Wharton.</p>

<h2 id="pick-3-big-data-finance-30">Pick #3: Big Data Finance 3.0</h2>

<p>Big Data Finance is a revolution as well as an evolution that has come into prominence after several decades. Chartists and other technical analysts since at least the 1920s have utilized market data to derive upcoming patterns of prices. Perhaps the first formal breakthrough in Big Data Finance occurred in the 1980s when companies like Bloomberg began packaging and delivering market data in large sets to investment professionals. Big Data Finance 1.0 allowed for extensive data mining, yet with still limited mathematical tools. Computer terminals were expensive, clunky and slow. Still, the inferences were valuable and much sought after.</p>

<p>Big Data Finance 2.0 came with the explosion of the Internet in the late 1990s. Suddenly, it became possible to receive streaming real-time or near-real-time financial data. The innovation enabled the growth of financial technologies such as electronic trading, and market making. Efficient online communication facilitated deal-making, globalization of trading, and much more. The efficiencies of Big Data Finance 2.0 streamlined financial services’ processes and brought down previously prohibitive costs of financial transactions by a factor of 100.</p>

<p>Big Data Finance 3.0 is presently upon us. Big Data Finance 3.0 is really about managing the scale of data and extracting the information within. Today’s big data is about faster, better analytics, an ability to extract that “needle from the haystack” using the latest data science inferences, and storing, managing and integrating ultra-large sets of streaming and historical data of all kinds: market data, social media data, news, regulations, announcements, and so on.</p>

<p>We have been quite diligent in assessing <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/understanding-the-fintech-effect">the value of FinTech</a> for the global ecosystem. So is the City of London with its fresh report on the value of FinTech. The data-rich, 71-page report explores how FinTech helps to address key issues in the financial services industry, outlining 10 recommendations for the Government, the financial services industry and the wider FinTech ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="pick-4-value-of-fintech--the-city-of-london-corporation">Pick #4: Value of FinTech – the City of London Corporation</h2>

<p>FinTech and key drivers of growth FinTechs, businesses which use technology to transform or enable business and operating models in the financial services (FS) sector have grown significantly in recent years.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/03-3e9676.png" alt="03-3e9676.png" /></p>

<p>Image source: <a href="https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/business/economic-research-and-information/research-publications/Pages/value-of-fintech.aspx">Value of FinTech</a></p>

<p>FinTechs have seen close to $1.5 billion in investments into banking, insurance and asset management each year since 2014.</p>

<p>The growth of FinTechs has been primarily driven by four factors:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Technological evolution: The fast pace of technological developments combined with a reduction in the cost of technology.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Emerging customer expectations: Customers now demand digital services and experiences similar to other sectors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Availability of funding and capital: Funding into FinTechs has increased significantly in the last several years.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support from governments and regulators: Both governments and regulators recognize FinTech as the evolution of financial services and proactively support them.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/uploads/033-b8d1d2.png" alt="033-b8d1d2.png" /></p>

<p>Role of the financial services system, Value of FinTech</p>

<p>Contactless payments have been a very sensitive business since the very beginning – none of the leading providers have been able to live up to optimistic expectations. A <a href="http://www.firstannapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/First-Annapolis_Mobile-Wallet-Report_March-2017-1.pdf">March 2017 study</a> found that while the percentage of people enrolled in Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay are at 34%, 14%, and 20% respectively, only 8%, 3%, and 6% respectively of those who are enrolled are actually using the service one time per week or more. The good news is that one of the largest banks in the US is now on board with boosting contactless tech usage.</p>

<h2 id="pick-5-over-5000-wells-fargo-atms-now-support-card-free-access-via-apple-pay-and-other-mobile-wallets--techcrunch">Pick #5: Over 5,000 Wells Fargo ATMs now support card-free access via Apple Pay and other mobile wallets – TechCrunch</h2>

<p>With the launch of NFC-enabled transactions, the number of card-free transactions is likely to grow by quite a bit. Consumers today are already familiar with how tap-and-pay works thanks to NFC-based point-of-sale systems at checkout. Plus, mobile payments adoption may have also gotten a boost in the wake of the switchover to chip-and-PIN credit cards in the US, where these new chip card transactions often take much longer to process than the traditional swipe ever did. That makes mobile payments even more appealing.</p>

<p>Because mobile payments are already understood by many of Wells Fargo’s over 20 million mobile banking and mobile wallet customers, few will need much education on how to take advantage of the NFC-enabled ATMs.</p>

<p>The bank says it plans to upgrade the remaining 8,000 or so ATMs by next year to support NFC transactions.</p>

<p>Wells Fargo isn’t the only bank prepping its systems for the contactless future. Last year, Bank of America also began offering NFC transactions at its ATMs, and Chase has announced its plans as well.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Today’s picks of interesting articles are going to be half-consistent in a good way, with one common thread – outstanding leaders working hard to define the FinServ realm. Startup Ripple is beyond buzzwords with over 100 clients on board, UBS banks half of the world’s billionaires, and JPMorgan’s disruptor-in-chief’s ‘obsession’ with Amazon brings out the best of tech into banking.</p>

<h2 id="startup-ripple-has-over-100-clients-as-mainstream-finance-warms-up-to-blockchain">Startup Ripple has over 100 clients as mainstream finance warms up to blockchain</h2>

<p>For a very long time, people in FinServ have questioned that will blockchain go from theory to reality. This is a major development from Ripple as it not only goes from being science experiment to having a hundred clients but has also done transactions – SEB, the Swedish bank, had used Ripple’s system to transfer $180 million between Sweden and the US in recent months to help manage the cash balances of one of the bank’s large corporate customers.</p>

<p>“The global payments industry really has been ruled by an oligopoly, led by players like JPMorgan and Citi,” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse told CNBC during a phone call Monday. “It’s certainly not that surprising to see Jamie Dimon’s comments recently on Bitcoin given that they (JPMorgan) control that oligopoly.”</p>

<h2 id="how-ubs-became-home-to-half-the-worlds-billionaires--never-say-never">How UBS Became Home to Half the World’s Billionaires – “Never Say Never”</h2>

<p>If you are in the mood to read a long interview, the one conducted by Bloomberg with the UBS’ CEO Sergio Ermotti, it is definitely worth the time. UBS is one of the world’s leading institutions defining the wealth management industry with around $700 billion of assets under management, more than a third of which – $250 billion – is passive.</p>

<p>BM: How different are things going to be in, say, three years?</p>

<p>Sergio Ermotti: For sure, it’s not going to be the same as today. I have to tell you that at the end of the day, I’m totally convinced that the battleground of banking is not the front office. The battleground is the back end. There’s no understandable reason why the financial-services industry has not developed a more comprehensive sharing of the value chain. This is partly because we are more regulated than many other industries, but it’s also because of profitability. And this is the first time the industry has gone through a prolonged period of deleveraging and contraction.</p>

<h2 id="jpmorgans-david-hudson-meet-dimons-disruptor-in-chief">JPMorgan’s David Hudson: Meet Dimon’s disruptor-in-chief</h2>

<p>“A persistent investment approach over the long term to try and do what our clients want and a tailwind of other firms not investing meant that we managed to gain more traction in FX,” says Hudson. “But at the back of our mind is that problem that it’s very easy to lose all this. Memories can be short and, at a basic level, if all you’re competing on is price and a pretty front end, then any FinTech could put together a platform and generate what seems like a similar experience in spot FX.”</p>

<p>“I have been somewhat obsessed with Amazon this year,” he says. “In many respects, it is bigger than JPMorgan – more people, more countries, bigger market capitalization, greater revenue and they probably move more things every day than we do trades. Yet I suspect that Amazon would probably be seen as a more innovative company, so it can’t be that big companies can’t be innovative, although it may be that most big companies aren’t innovative.”</p>

<p><em>Everything new is well-forgotten old.</em></p>

<p>FinTech is not a disruptive force (and <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/45-plus-use-cases-for-blockchain-technology/">blockchain is not a disruptive technology</a>). Rather, it’s the history of institutional banking repeating itself. And the further into 2017, the more apparent it is that the global market is extremely limited for <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/">~8K FinTech startups</a> to have a sustainable future altogether. In the years ahead, the success denominator in FinTech will be its scale. Only the ones able to score powerful partnerships will step into the next phase of development – institutionalization, which is a short track to becoming another financial institution and they very same type of organization tech entrepreneurs are now so passionate to call obsolete.
Let’s look at some of the most recent events falling into the proposed frame. It starts with identifying who are the main figures, and what are their strategies.</p>

<h2 id="partnerships-acqui-hires-and-institutionalization">Partnerships, acqui-hires, and institutionalization</h2>

<p>At the beginning of October, accounting software firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/02/curve-accounting/">Xero partnered with Curve</a>, a startup that lets you consolidate all your bank cards into a single card and track your spending. Six months ago, Xero passed <a href="https://www.xero.com/blog/2017/03/thanks-a-million/">1 million</a> subscribers worldwide on its global cloud accounting platform – 20X the number from five years ago, when the count was at just 50,000 subscribers. Xero also counts 100,000 business advisors – not too bad of a partner for up and coming Curve, whose cardholders having spent almost £70 million in over 100 countries.</p>

<p>Around the same time, Adyen, a global payments company, <a href="https://www.adyen.com/press-and-media/press-releases/press-release-detail/2017/adyen-simplifies-marketplace-payments-with-marketpay">launched MarketPay</a>, a flexible end-to-end payments solution allowing online marketplaces to control the full payment stack, own the customer experience, easily sign up and pay out sellers, and expand into new markets. More importantly, Adyen has partnered with GoFundMe, the world’s largest personal fundraising platform, which will be using MarketPay to provide the best possible payments experience for over 40 million donors and campaign organizers across Europe and the United States. Just like GoFundMe, Adyen is no rookie in FinTech. GoFundMe has become the number one crowdfunding and fundraising platform in the world, raising more than <a href="https://www.adyen.com/press-and-media/press-releases/press-release-detail/2017/adyen-simplifies-marketplace-payments-with-marketpay">$4 billion</a> in donations. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.adyen.com/customers">Adyen’s customers</a> count Uber, Netflix, Groupon, TransferWise, Spotify, LinkedIn, Evernote, and a lot more. The company saw an 80% volume growth, 99% revenue growth, and $727 million revenue in 2016. Adyen processed $90 billion in 2016 through its 250+ payment methods across 150+ transaction currencies.</p>

<p>Last week, FinTech startup Earnest has agreed to be acquired by student loan servicing giant Navient, the country’s largest student loan servicing company, for $155 million in cash. The acquisition will be a launching pad for Navient to begin originating its own student loans. Since its spin-off from Sallie Mae in 2014, it has focused on servicing and collecting some $300 billion in existing private and federal students loans, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurengensler/2017/10/04/earnest-acquired-by-navient-fintech-student-loans/#7e82f1f27e19">Forbes reports</a>. Founded in 2013, Earnest provides student loan refinancing to young borrowers with thin credit files by leveraging tens of thousands of data points, many of which are unconventional, the edition adds. Since Earnest <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/year-1-100-building-bank-future-louis-beryl/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_post_details%3BQMcNXQG2T3CEpUan7MiJ2Q%3D%3D">launched its student loan refinancing product</a> in January 2015, with a focus on better pricing and repayment flexibility, the company has refinanced nearly <a href="https://www.earnest.com/blog/earnest-and-navient/">$2 billion</a> of student loans. That has created savings of more than $500,000,000 for tens of thousands of Earnest clients. By pairing Earnest’s technology, innovation, and data-driven approach with Navient’s reach and resources, the companies want to affect change at incredible scale.</p>

<p>This summer, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/09/stripe-strikes-global-partnerships-with-chinas-alipay-wechat-pay.html">Stripe scored global partnerships with China’s Alipay, and WeChat Pay</a> to enable merchants using its platform globally to accept payments from hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers. The most important part – in China, Alipay and Tenpay, together <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/7k-fintech-startups-globally-will-fall-victim-to-consolidation-in-finserv/">run a duopoly over mobile payments in the country</a>, with <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/alipay-and-tenpay-give-up-transaction-data-in-china-2017-8">91%</a> of the market. For Stripe, the partnership with one of the leaders is golden ticket accepted ubiquitously in one of the hottest FinTech markets. Alipay is valued at over <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/pwc-fintech-startup-partnerships-key-to-banks-survival">$70 billion</a> due to its massive user base of 400 million registered users and annual payment volume of $519 billion.</p>

<p>One would notice there are no micro-players among examples, and for a very good reason – consolidation happens among the strongest. Companies with the most traction, resources, and potential, seek powerful alliances to expand into new niches, new customer bases, and strengthen market position.</p>

<p>Partnerships are not only a fast track to success in FinTech. Banks have also come to realize the tangible benefits of partnerships. Studies suggest that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2017/02/13/is-2017-the-year-bank-fintech-partnerships-hit-productmarket-fit/2/#6e08e5cb112d">87%</a> of banks that have partnered with third-party financial service providers (FinTech companies) have been able to cut costs. Additionally, 54% of partnerships increased revenue, Forbes cites.</p>

<p>There are many more examples: MasterCard and PayPal <a href="https://newsroom.mastercard.com/press-releases/paypal-and-mastercard-expand-partnership-to-benefit-consumers-merchants-and-financial-institutions/">announced</a> an important expansion of their long-standing partnership that will enhance the consumer experience by making Mastercard a clear payment option within PayPal, enable Masterpass as a payment option for Braintree merchants and expand PayPal’s presence at POS. An institutionalization example is SoFi, which <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/40415-sofi-files-for-fdic-bank-charter">filed an application with FDIC for a bank charter</a> earlier this year. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/square-will-apply-for-an-industrial-loan-company-license-this-week/">So did Square</a> at the beginning of September, although for a different type of a charter. At the end of last week, Moneyfarm, the UK-headquartered digital wealth manager, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/06/digital-wealth-manager-moneyfarm-acquires-tech-behind-fintech-chatbot-ernest/">acqui-hired the technology behind personal finance chatbot Ernest</a>, with Ernest’s CTO Lorenzo Sicilia joining Moneyfarm to oversee technology integration. Just a day ago, <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/fintech-startup-qbera-join-partners-with-droom-to-enable-used-car-financing/articleshow/61003578.cms">FinTech lender Qbera has partnered with online automobile marketplace Droom</a> to enable loans for vehicle purchases on the latter’s platform.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2015/01/16/90-of-startups-will-fail-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-10/#439b59b36679">90% of FinTech startups fail</a>. For a <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/traps-and-pitfalls-for-fintech-startups/">variety of reasons</a>: no one wants the product, cash shortage, etc. So, out of thousands of FinTech startups so eager to make a name for themselves, only 10% have a resemblance of a chance. Out of that 10 %, only the ones capable of consolidating and expanding across niches will acquire a significant enough footing in the market to ensure resilience and sustainable long-term growth.</p>

<p>To understand the beauty of the current events, I’d like us to take a look at the event of the past – the middle of the 20th century, in particular. <a href="https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/our_business/history-of-visa.html">Visa’s journey</a> begins in 1958, the year that Bank of America launched the first consumer credit card program for middle-class consumers and SME merchants in the US (reminds of innovators launching <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/interview-with-janet-zablock-head-global-small-business-visa/">solutions for small businesses</a> in the past few years?). It didn’t take long for the company to grow and expand internationally in 1974 (<a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/25-fintech-startups-that-expanded-globally-despite-regulations-other-problems/">just like FinTech companies do, jumping through hoops</a>), and introduce the debit card in 1975. In 2006, <a href="https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/history-of-visa-1273.php">Visa became a private membership association</a> jointly owned by over 20,000 member financial institutions worldwide. In 2007, regional businesses around the world were merged to form Visa Inc. and, followed by the company going public in 2008 in one of the largest IPOs in history. In 2016, Visa completed the acquisition of Visa Europe.</p>

<p>What started as a BankAmericard program in Fresno, Calif., grew into the Visa we know now, which operates in more than 200 countries and territories with products and services available on any device – cards, laptops, tablets and mobile devices. Visa played a unifying role for the financial institutions around the world, instead of remaining one of many localized connecting tissues for groups of institutions.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-this-all-mean">What does this all mean?</h2>

<p>The largest FinTech startups are repeating the history of Visa whether they want/realize it or not. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/08/dear-silicon-valley-americas-fallen-out-of-love-with-you/">Silicon Valley is the Wall Street of 2017</a>, and to expect it to remain in infancy (under which we understand <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/mobile-wallets-when-too-many-pays-wont-let-anyone-win/">disjoint experiences and proprietary islands</a>) would mean to misunderstand the importance of scale and convenience when it comes to delivering and consuming financial services.</p>

<p>Competition has been shown to be useful up to a certain point and no further, but cooperation, which is the thing we must strive for today, begins where competition leaves off. – Franklin D. Roosevelt</p>

                <title>Virtual Cards: The B2B Payment Method of the Future</title>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>When it comes to <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/fintech-impacting-b2b-payments/">payments in the B2B world</a>, customers are looking for more convenient ways to pay their bills. With the latest technological advancements, their options are expanding. As with any new technology, however, new challenges arrive that can slow down the invoice-to-cash process. But if a supplier has the right <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/cash-flow-management-arap-automation-the-most-important-innovation-for-small-businesses/">A/R process</a> in place, new technology doesn’t have to mean that there will be new challenges to overcome.</p>

<p>Virtual cards, also known as Single-Use Accounts (SUA), are among the latest in <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/overview-of-the-payments-industry/">payments technologies</a>. They are auto-generated credit card numbers that A/P departments can send to suppliers as a link contained in an email, for a one-time-use payment. Their growing popularity with customers is due to a variety of factors.</p>

<p>One reason is that virtual cards provide A/P departments visibility and control over the buyer’s payments. Another reason is that they automate the account reconciliation process – the more automated the process, the less chance for human error. Additionally, there is an increased level of security on the payments side. We’ve already discussed that virtual cards have a one-time use, randomly generated number. But they can also be set to the exact cost of the bill and can be set to expire after a specific amount of time, reducing the chance of theft or fraud.</p>

<p>On the flip side, this emerging payment process introduces new challenges for the suppliers and the A/R side of the invoice-to-cash process:</p>

<h2 id="processes-inefficiencies">Processes inefficiencies</h2>

<p>One challenge is that the infrastructure that supports virtual card payments does not currently integrate neatly with ERP systems to enable straight-through processing. In addition, while the issuing of a single-use number is automated, the supplier processing side of it is not. Consequently, A/R departments receiving virtual card payments often have to manually retrieve the card number and remittance information, process the payment and then manually apply the cash into their ERP system.</p>

<h2 id="interchange-fees">Interchange fees</h2>

<p>If a supplier is given a virtual card number for payment, this will often require them to pay an interchange fee on each transaction that is completed. While these interchange fees can differ based on the type of card used, fees can get expensive, costing suppliers an average of 2.5% of the payment per transaction.</p>

<h2 id="security-gaps">Security gaps</h2>

<p>While the A/P department may start using virtual cards due to its improved security, on the A/R side, there can actually be some increased security risks. A company receiving credit card payments, for example, needs to be PCI-compliant, which means they need to comply with Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) in order to host credit card data securely with a hosting provider.</p>

<p>Additionally, while buyers may have a secure system to send the virtual card payment email, the supplier’s email may not be as secure. Ensuring appropriate security protocols can be costly for many suppliers and can open up businesses to data breach risks.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-of-virtual-card-payments">The future of virtual card payments</h2>

<p>Despite its challenges, virtual card payments are not going away. In fact, their usage is growing almost 10% annually. By 2021, virtual card spending is expected to surpass that of traditional purchasing cards and checks. And as we are seeing that increase in the volume of emailed virtual card payments, we are also seeing further strains being put on businesses’ A/R departments.</p>

<p>But that strain can be relieved if the A/R department implements its own automated solution to process those virtual card payments. A part of that solution should include a comprehensive electronic invoice presentment and payment (EIPP) portal. A good portal will give A/R teams the ability to completely automate the payments process, and that includes virtual card payments. When searching for an EIPP portal, suppliers should find one that can accept payments, generate the payment file, easily integrate with their ERP and then automatically close out each invoice as it is paid. Additionally, it should be PCI-compliant and should incorporate the highest security standards and latest encryption technologies.</p>

<h2 id="diagram-how-virtual-card-capture-works">Diagram: How Virtual Card Capture works</h2>

<p><img src="/uploads/Virt%20(1).jpg" alt="Virt (1).jpg" /></p>

<p>While virtual cards are not yet mainstream today, they are projected to become commonplace in the near future. As companies utilize more automation in their businesses, virtual cards will be a natural part of the B2B payment process. The ability to handle this payment process seamlessly will result in more predictable cash flow and higher customer satisfaction.</p>

<p>When I was first doing research on the <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/21-areas-of-blockchain-application-beyond-financial-services/">non-financial use cases of blockchain technology with particular examples</a> to continue our diligent following on <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/research-categories/blockchain-use-cases-comprehensive-analysis-startups-involved">how it can be applied in FinServ and beyond</a>, 21 seemed like a big deal. No number would surprise me today though – the Global Blockchain Benchmarking Study by <a href="http://www.garrickhileman.com/">Dr. Garrick Hileman</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michel-rauchs-6100715b/">Michel Rauchs</a> published by the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance (there is also one on <a href="https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/research/centres/alternative-finance/downloads/2017-global-cryptocurrency-benchmarking-study.pdf">cryptocurrency</a>), lists 45+ use cases for blockchain technology in an extensive publication exploring the maturity, benefits, challenges in adoption of the technology, along with outlining the landscape. And today, I’d like to highlight two sides to this outstanding study – a technological capability and a business need.</p>

<p>In other words, where does an exploration of a technological capability stop making business sense, and starts being a research for the sake of research?</p>

<p>Wow! Did Marvel reserve the movie rights for a Blockchain Superhero already?</p>

<p>On a serious note, while the report is definitely a must-read and I wanted to share it with our audience, this list is not the main reason – it is the scale of efforts and hype that concerns. In a rally to apply blockchain technology everywhere imaginable and unimaginable, we may forget to ask if every theoretical use case for the technology has a sustainable future in our society, and makes business sense. And the next piece I’d like to share today is another side of the coin well worth looking at:</p>

<h2 id="the-truth-about-blockchain--marco-iansiti-and-karim-r-lakhani-a-framework-for-blockchain-adoption">The Truth About Blockchain – Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani (A framework for blockchain adoption)</h2>

<p>“Indeed, virtually everyone has heard the claim that blockchain will revolutionize business and redefine companies and economies. Although we share the enthusiasm for its potential, we worry about the hype. It’s not just security issues (such as the 2014 collapse of one Bitcoin exchange and the more recent hacks of others) that concern us. Our experience studying technological innovation tells us that if there’s to be a blockchain revolution, many barriers—technological, governance, organizational, and even societal—will have to fall. It would be a mistake to rush headlong into blockchain innovation without understanding how it is likely to take hold.</p>

<p>True blockchain-led transformation of business and government, we believe, is still many years away. That’s because blockchain is not a “disruptive” technology, which can attack a traditional business model with a lower-cost solution and overtake incumbent firms quickly. Blockchain is a foundational technology: It has the potential to create new foundations for our economic and social systems. But while the impact will be enormous, it will take decades for blockchain to seep into our economic and social infrastructure. The process of adoption will be gradual and steady, not sudden, as waves of technological and institutional change gain momentum. That insight and its strategic implications are what we’ll explore in this article.”</p>

<p>There is no argument on the importance of exploration of opportunities that blockchain technology opens to businesses – in a variety of cases, the technology indeed will breed a new generation of businesses operating with an unprecedented efficiency to create value.</p>

<p>“Transformative scenarios will take off last, but they will also deliver enormous value. Two areas where they could have a profound impact: large-scale public identity systems for such functions as passport control, and algorithm-driven decision making in the prevention of money laundering and in complex financial transactions that involve many parties. We expect these applications won’t reach broad adoption and critical mass for at least another decade and probably more.</p>

<p>Transformative applications will also give rise to new platform-level players that will coordinate and govern the new ecosystems. These will be the Googles and Facebooks of the next generation. It will require patience to realize such opportunities. Though it may be premature to start making significant investments in them now, developing the required foundations for them—tools and standards—is still worthwhile.”</p>

<p>The piece by Iansiti and Lakhani is brilliant. An important takeaway from both publications is that every generation of fundamental transformation comes slowly – it requires a massive adoption and cross-operability of the underlying infrastructure. “…it took more than 30 years for TCP/IP to move through all the phases—single use, localized use, substitution, and transformation—and reshape the economy. Today more than half the world’s most valuable public companies have internet-driven, platform-based business models. The very foundations of our economy have changed.”</p>

<p>With blockchain technology use cases, it’s important to tame the hype around potential in favor of hard work and laying ground for the Googles and Facebooks of the new world. No use case is of use if the infrastructure is not ready.</p>

<p>Debt collection is definitely not the sexiest segment in the financial services industry. To be honest, the experience just straight-forward sucks for everyone involved in this horrendous process – lenders and borrowers alike. Nonetheless, debt remains a constant in the lives of a massive number of individuals around the world. By the end of Q2 2017, total outstanding consumer debt in the US alone hit <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G19/current/">$3.7 trillion</a> (+<a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html">$9.14 trillion</a> of housing debt) – a volume not yet sufficiently addressed neither by financial institutions, nor by technology startups with the exception of a few interesting examples (like <a href="https://www.trueaccord.com/">True Accord</a>, <a href="https://www.indebted.co/">InDebted</a>, <a href="https://www.collect.ai/">collectAI</a>, <a href="http://symend.com/">Symend</a>, <a href="https://collectly.co/">Collectly</a>).</p>

<p>According to the latest <a href="https://atradiuscollections.com/us/publications/international-debt-collections-handbook.html">International Debt Collections Handbook</a> (USA) published in June 2017, the estimated success rate of collections between 01/2014 and 12/2016 in the United States was just at 36.7% (with the same metric for Canada estimated to be at 17.7%, UK at 65.8%, Mexico at 38.7%, China at 23.9%, India at 17.3%, Germany at 63.9%, and France at 67.8%). Despite the potential market size and almost miserable collections success rate in a large number of developed and developing countries, debt collection startups are some of the most underrepresented ones in <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/">the global FinTech community</a>.</p>

<p>Lack of transformative work and attention to this common practice left debt collection practices very retrograded for 2017. It’s almost hard to believe that technology startups addressing this massive issue are the loneliest ones (although, one could argue it’s not a bad thing – the less competition, the better), with a certain regional variance in approach to changing the experience with debt collection. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sofya-pogreb-8876b7/">Sofya Pogreb</a>, the former COO of TrueAccord, emphasizes that <a href="https://blog.trueaccord.com/2016/08/lonely-debt-collection-startups-box/">the barriers to entry into the debt collection business are significant</a>, mentioning that it took TrueAccord over two years to become fully licensed (as most states have separate licensing processes and requirements).</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://atradiuscollections.com/global/publications/global-collections-review.html">The Global Collections Review</a> (Europe, Americas, and Asia-Pacific) by <a href="https://atradiuscollections.com/global/">Atradius Collections</a> (a B2B debt collections services company), published in September 2017, reveals that the companies’ attitude towards the collections market is strongly focused on internal management. Professional debt collection is still difficult to manage, the study notes, but the approach to alternative solutions offered in the collections market displays a noticeable variance among companies in different countries.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/fint2.png" alt="fint2.png" /></p>

<p>Image source: <a href="https://atradiuscollections.com/global/publications/global-collections-review.html">The Global Collections Review</a> (Europe, Americas, and Asia-Pacific), 2017</p>

<p>Italy, Spain, Germany, France and Belgium, as well as China, India, Indonesia, Mexico and Brazil are found to be more inclined to adopt alternative or additional solutions to traditional debt collection services, compared to the general tendency among the other countries profiled in the report. In general, according to Atradius Collections, companies in Europe appear to be more cautious of using alternative services other than traditional debt collection. Companies in the Americas and APAC show a stronger openness towards service innovation.</p>

<h2 id="how-fintech-is-changing-debt-collection-behavioral-analytics-ml-ai-data-analytics-and-sophisticated-communication-strategy">How FinTech is changing debt collection: behavioral analytics, ML, AI, data analytics, and sophisticated communication strategy</h2>

<p>So, how exactly technology startups around the world are intervening to reimagine the debt collection experience? Let’s look at some of them to understand what exactly they bring into play.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.indebted.co/">InDebted</a> (operates in Australia and New Zealand/UK and the US coming soon), for example, simply moves the whole collection experience for businesses online, offering a portal where clients can monitor the status of collections performed by InDebted representatives. Once InDebted collects client’s debt and the payment clears, the funds are transferred to the client’s account the same day. The pricing is very clear and transparent, although somewhat hefty, dare I say – the company charges a flat 20% fee on anything it collects.</p>

<p>While the first case roughly reminds of a traditional experience moved online, <a href="https://www.trueaccord.com/">TrueAccord</a> is probably a bit more interesting case – the company operates a data-driven debt collection platform powered by ML and digital-first communications. TrueAccord’s Patent Pending decision engine uses ML to create personalized, digital-first, consumer experiences that are uniquely tailored for each consumer. The platform uses a machine to create a complex interaction model with a consumer, and a clustering engine to compare the consumer to more than 1.5 million consumers who passed through the platform. Based on those 100’s of millions of data points, it predicts the consumer’s reaction to communication frequency, timing, channel, and content.</p>

<p>TrueAccord’s decision engine then selects from hundreds of internally generated and legally pre-approved messages that drive consumer engagement via omnichannel delivery. Once delivered, it tracks real-time events from the consumer – email opens, link clicks, browsing pattern on TrueAccord assets and interaction with the company’s call center – to decide what its next step should be. TrueAccord’s Compliance Firewall enforces compliance rules on contact timing, frequency, and included disclosures. The Compliance Firewall allows implementation of new rules at scale, as state-level rules may vary, and keeps a detailed event log for audit purposes.</p>

<p>TrueAccord enables customized offers and payment plans to enable consumers to successfully pay off more of their debt. The features of the platform include behavioral analytics, code-driven compliance, audit trail, real-time personalization, and more. LendUp, Yelp, and UpWork are among the company’s clients.</p>

<p>Another interesting newcomer, <a href="https://collectly.co/">Collectly</a> (focuses on medical bills currently), aims to improve creditor collection of the outstanding debt through personalized and automated communication (also, the person who built the platform is an ML expert). The collection service for healthcare providers and medical billing companies combines information on patients from multiple EHR systems, analyzes it, and executes collections.</p>

<p>As shared by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/14/collectly-1-9-million/">TechCrunch</a>, while most debt collection agencies still use paper mailings and phone calls in their attempts to recover their clients’ money, Collectly is moving its interactions online (similar to competitors), tracking and collecting data from debtors in how they respond — or don’t respond — to its outreach. By creating a more personalized outreach and collection strategy, the company attempts to provide people who owe money with appropriately structured repayment solutions that allow clients to recoup some of their losses, even if debtors can’t pay the whole amount owed.</p>

<p>We have also mentioned earlier a company called <a href="https://www.collect.ai/">collectAI</a>, which provides AI-based collection services to help its clients manage account receivables. collectAI’s services include e-invoicing, dunning, and debt collection. The company’s self-learning AI system supports the complete value chain around collectAI’s services, continuously learning and trying to optimize the result. While the company does claim to leverage AI around all services, with debt collection, a strong emphasis is made on efficient, multi-channel communication and UX, rather than the application of the technology in a sense as it does the previous example.</p>

<p><a href="http://symend.com/">Symend</a>, a Canadian debt recovery solution, claims that US delinquent debt has risen from $150 billion to over $600 billion in the last five years, and places current collections tactics into the bucket of ineffective and only yielding a success rate of ~7%. The company claims to combine predictive analytics, automation, and positive collection tactics (a common practice among the technology companies aiming to tackle the issue). The solution brings together a comprehensive data mining, relationship management tools, and strategic campaign tactics across all customer channels. Predictive analytics drive workflow recommendations, allowing client’s accounts receivable team to reach more customers through workflow automation. Clients are able to access complete customer profiles and behavioral tracking while extending payment options and online processing to their customer base.</p>

<p>There are certainly more examples, which vary in the ways they leverage technology (or not), in offered functionality and business models. But most importantly, they vary in the approach and a heavier focus on one side or another. There is a class of players that offer a sophisticated ‘communication scheduling’ software to reduce the collection time, but do not particularly emphasize a change in approach from the debtor’s perspective. Others are more advanced in the application of mentioned earlier technologies (cloud, ML, AI, behavioral analytics), but again, the emphasis of those companies is on businesses recovering money as effectively as possible, while the debtor’s experience is somewhat on a Stone Age level. A few more examples to mention are <a href="https://debtordaddy.com/">Debtor Daddy</a>, <a href="https://www.interprose.com/">InterProse</a>, <a href="https://www.simplicitycollectionsoftware.com/">Simplicity Collection Software</a>, <a href="https://collbox.co/">CollBox</a>, <a href="https://debito.dk/">Debito</a>, and others.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-best-markets-for-a-debt-collection-innovation">What are the best markets for a debt collection innovation?</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://atradiuscollections.com/global/reports/insolvency-forecasts-august-2017.html">Insolvency Matrix 2017</a> provides a relatively comprehensive overview of the tendencies in particular market, indicating the ones most in need for solutions improving debt collection.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/fint3.png" alt="fint3.png" /></p>

<p>Image: <a href="https://atradiuscollections.com/global/reports/insolvency-forecasts-august-2017.html">Insolvency Matrix 2017</a></p>

<p>The countries with average to highest insolvency rates that are either remaining stable or deteriorating include Denmark, Belgium, Sweden, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/sharp-and-edgy-switzerlands-fintech-ecosystem/">Switzerland</a>, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/norway-fintech-landscape/">Norway</a>, and a number of other developed economies. In the near future, those markets would face the most severe need in change of practices and technologies applied to debt collection in order to turn around the insolvency rates and improve debt management. Overall, <a href="https://atradiuscollections.com/global/reports/insolvency-forecasts-august-2017.html">global business insolvencies are expected to decrease 3.0% this year and 2.0% in 2018</a>, particularly led by an increasingly robust recovery in the Eurozone.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>With <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/which-are-the-top-3-hottest-fintech-hubs-worldwide/">the usual suspects</a> maintaining a strong grip on the world’s attention (we are talking about <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/hong-kong-fintech-ecosystem-startups-regulators-investors-accelerators/">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/singapores-fintech-industry-global-leadership/">Singapore</a>, and <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/fintech-startups-defining-new-york-fintech-industry/">New York</a>), it’s easy to overlook emerging markets offering outstanding opportunities to international tech and finance talent. One of those markets is Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) – a unique region that has been making unprecedented strides to bring innovation to every level of the government and business operations. Being an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/889422a8-09ad-11e7-ac5a-903b21361b43">economic success story</a> for the past two decades, CEE countries are continuously reinventing their economies to adapt to <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/how-fintech-became-an-international-unifying-phenomenon/">the changing world</a>.</p>

<p>Europe remains one of the world’s top regions for executives, experts note in an <a href="http://www.ey.com/gl/en/issues/business-environment/ey-attractiveness-survey-europe-may-2017">attractiveness survey 2017 (Europe)</a>. Despite major geopolitical events, growth around the world facilitates demand for European products and services and gives business decision makers the confidence to expand and invest. Asked to rank the attractiveness of global regions, investors vote Western Europe first overall (53%), followed by US (39%) and CEE (37%).</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/in-2.png" alt="in-2.png" /></p>

<p>Image: CEE key economic indicators; <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/central-europe/ce-fintech-in-cee-region-2016.pdf">FinTech in CEE: Charting the course for innovation in financial services technology</a></p>

<p>In total, the CEE FinTech market is estimated to be worth over <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/central-europe/ce-fintech-in-cee-region-2016.pdf">€2.2 billion</a>, with the FinTech investment market in the region to grow at <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/central-europe/ce-fintech-in-cee-region-2016.pdf">55%</a> annually until 2020. A recent <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/central-europe/ce-fintech-in-cee-region-2016.pdf">comprehensive study on CEE FinTech</a> reveals that innovations for the banking sector provide the greatest share of FinTech solutions in all CEE countries. Such solutions are highly developed in virtually all countries (internet and mobile banking, contactless cards, etc.).</p>

<p>Insurance and asset management sectors are considered to be far behind, with the focus in the insurance industry being on improving distribution channels (apps, gamification), and launching new services based on telematics. The asset management sector is deemed to be still conservative with most financial institutions using systems provided by traditional vendors, which, on the positive side, represents existing opportunities to break down the dominance of these players by offering exible and inexpensive solutions.</p>

<p>In an extensive <a href="http://emd-drupal-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Survey.pdf">CEE FinTech Survey 2017</a>, professionals outline Estonia as CEE’s near-runaway tech-leader, with the government encouraging or even requiring the digitization of business processes and many aspects of daily interactions with the public sector, with knock-on effects for ICT businesses. In fact, Estonia became <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/9-reasons-to-launch-expand-startup-in-estonia/">the first country to offer e-Residency</a>, a government-issued digital ID available to anyone in the world. E-Residency offers the freedom to easily start and run a global business in a trusted EU environment. The e-Residency project was launched on December 1, 2014. As of March 15, 2017, over <a href="https://e-resident.gov.ee/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/e-Residencyspeakingpoints.pdf">18,300</a> people from 136 countries worldwide had applied for and over 17,300 have received the eID. By the same time, over 1,400 e-residents have established a company and there are over 2,700 companies connected to e-residents (owners, board members, etc.).</p>

<p>Another interesting contender among the CEE countries is Poland, which has been widely considered to be among the frontrunners as a hub of technological innovation. “We want the region to become the center of innovation. It is our responsibility to create an ecosystem in which you will be able to develop your talent,” Beata Szydlo, Poland’s prime minister, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/889422a8-09ad-11e7-ac5a-903b21361b43">said to</a> an audience of nearly 1,000 entrepreneurs and investors from local countries <a href="https://www.premier.gov.pl/en/news/news/prime-ministers-of-the-visegrad-group-signed-the-warsaw-declaration.html">gathered in Warsaw</a>.”We create, as a country, good conditions for entrepreneurs and we connect it with science. Then we hope and we know that it will have a positive impact on the economy she added. We want you to make your dreams come true here, in your countries, and through making them come true, help us all make our dream about the development and safety for our region come true.”</p>

<p>The philosophy underlines <a href="http://emd-drupal-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Survey.pdf">one of the most promising features of the Polish FinTech landscape</a> – growing cooperation between the banks and tech companies; the latter are not developing their products in a vacuum, and the former are not shying away from embracing new technologies.</p>

<p>“Poland is widely considered as being in the vanguard of global financial digitization. We are a playground for Western partners to test and popularize the most advanced customer interfaces and payment methods. Already, as far as standards are concerned we are ahead vis-a-vis regional markets and even Western [European] neighbors,” <a href="http://startuphub.pl/">StartUp Hub Poland</a>’s CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maciek-sadowski/">Maciek Sadowski</a> <a href="http://emd-drupal-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Survey.pdf">explains</a>. “As well as providing a large pool of potential customers for FinTech, this also allows developers and banks looking to offer the technology internationally fairly robust “proof of concept”, at a relatively lower price than in Western European countries.”</p>

<p>Mentioning other notable CEE FinTech markets, professionals emphasize Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Each of these countries, while largely overlooked, offers unique opportunities for FinTech professionals.</p>

<p>Rarely mentioned, Russia is another emerging hotbed for FinTech. As well as having the largest domestic market in CEE, <a href="http://emd-drupal-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Survey.pdf">FinTech professionals admit</a> it has a modern banking system and well-developed cybersecurity industry, and churns out programmers from its universities (in 2017, half of the top 10 best-performing universities in the global ACM-International Collegiate Programming Competition were Russian). Some of the FinTech professionals participated in a <a href="http://emd-drupal-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Survey.pdf">survey in 2017</a> believe that Russia, and probably to a greater extent Ukraine and Belarus, will increasingly provide the brainpower for <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/central-europe/ce-fintech-in-cee-region-2016.pdf">FinTech centers around the CEE region</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Austria</strong></p>

<p>Austria has the highest level of internet access in CEE (82% vs. the 75% average for CEE). Austria also has the highest ratio of smartphone penetration – 66% compared to the average of 56% for CEE countries.</p>

<p>In Austria, one in four invoices is electronic: the average in the CEE region is half as many.</p>

<p>The share of e-government users in Austria is the highest among CEE countries (37%), and exceeds the EU average (32%).</p>

<p>Almost the entire population aged 15+ has a current account with a financial institution (97%).</p>

<p><strong>Bulgaria</strong></p>

<p>Real GDP is expected to increase by 2.0% in 2017.</p>

<p>In 2014 there was a reversal in the trend for growing unemployment. The rate decreased to 11.4% and is expected to fall further to 8.8% in 2017.</p>

<p>Bulgaria’s corporate income tax (CIT) rate is the lowest in the EU at 10%. The personal income tax rate is also at 10%. Industries that face structural unemployment issues are granted a 0% tax rate.</p>

<p><strong>Croatia</strong></p>

<p>GDP growth, observed in 2015 for the first time since the crisis, is expected to remain stable in 2016-17 (2.1% on average), while the unemployment rate is forecast to drop below 14.0% in 2017 from 17.3% in 2014.</p>

<p>Labor market reforms in 2013 and 2014 aimed to facilitate the use of flexible types of employment.</p>

<p>Since Croatia joined the EU (January 1st, 2013), its trade connections have been improving.</p>

<p>Croatia is planning to invest €203 million into fast broadband through the use of Structural Funds.</p>

<p><strong>Czech Republic</strong></p>

<p>Forecast GDP growth of 2.7% for 2017.</p>

<p>Total R&amp;D intensity (research and development expenditure as a percentage of GDP) is forecast to reach 2.9% in 2020, only slightly below the EU target of 3.0%.</p>

<p>The government has implemented the Business Corporations Act, aimed at facilitating setting a business by substantially reducing the minimum capital requirements.</p>

<p>The ratio of public debt to GDP is forecast to fall in the next two years.</p>

<p>Hosts <a href="http://phoenixconf.io/">Phoenix conference</a>, bringing together international executives in partnership with F6S, <a href="https://www.auka.io/">Auka</a>, <a href="https://www.innovatrics.com/">Innovatrics</a>, and many others.</p>

<p><strong>Hungary</strong></p>

<p>As the market situation slowly improves, crisis taxes and the fiscal burden are being gradually eased off.</p>

<p>Society follows technological trends: internet penetration is 76%, 60% of the population has Facebook accounts and 55% have smartphones, all spelling opportunities for the further development and adoption of digital solutions.</p>

<p>Digital entrepreneurship is moving up the government’s agenda: numerous initiatives have already been launched to support this area, such as <a href="http://kibu.hu/">Kitchen Budapest</a> and <a href="http://www.colabs.hu/">Colabs</a> (incubators), and Web 2.0 (a competition for startups).</p>

<p><strong>Poland</strong></p>

<p>The high level of business-cycle synchronization with the advanced German economy, due to an integrated supply chain (exports to Germany accounted for 26% of all Polish exports in 2014).</p>

<p>Poland is the largest beneficiary of EU support. The EU will have allocated €82.5 billion to Poland over the 2014–2020 period.</p>

<p>There is a possibility of obtaining dedicated public aid, granted on the basis of an agreement between the Minister of the Economy and the investor. Companies planning to invest in seven selected industries, including R&amp;D and biotechnology sectors, can apply for support.</p>

<p>Numerous domestic FinTech startups and mature companies are operating both in Poland and abroad.</p>

<p><strong>Romania</strong></p>

<p>Romania has the fastest broadband internet in Europe – the peak connection speed is close to 60 Mbps, and 16% of all connections have a speed of 100+ Mbps.</p>

<p>The Romanian government actively supports domestic companies and foreign investors through state aid schemes, tax incentives, super deductions (150%) for R&amp;D investments and low CIT.</p>

<p>Romania was ranked 37th in the global <a href="http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings">“Doing Business” Index 2016</a> (with improvement noted in the areas of paying taxes, enforcing contracts and resolving insolvencies).</p>

<p>An increase in public investment is expected over the years to come.</p>

<p><strong>Slovakia</strong></p>

<p>Slovakia has exited the EU’s excessive deficit procedure, and the government expects to achieve a balanced budget by 2018. EU funds are likely to improve the country’s infrastructure.</p>

<p>Business confidence in the country is recovering after the crisis, driving investment growth.</p>

<p>The government is planning to further develop broadband access by rolling out fiber optic networks in rural areas.</p>

<p>Slovakia jumped to 29th place in the “Doing Business Index” in 2016, up from 37th the year before. Most important improvements included the shortening of time required to register a company (following the launch of a one-stop shop), the elimination of the requirement for a notary to verify signatures, and a reduction in corporate tax rates.</p>

<p>Slovakia offers several incentives (such as cash grants) and investment support to companies operating in technological centers.</p>

<p>Slovakia has one of the highest rates of cloud computing adoption in Eastern Europe.</p>

<p><strong>Slovenia</strong></p>

<p>GDP growth is expected to accelerate in 2017 (2.3%) after a slowdown in 2016.</p>

<p>Slovenia improved from 35th place in 2015 to 29th in 2016 in the global “Doing Business” ranking due to reforms in the fields of insolvency resolution, the enforcement of legal contracts and real estate management.</p>

<p>Slovenia adopted a new FDI strategy and a smart specialization strategy in 2015 (25% of measures included in the Single document – the Slovenian government’s initiative aimed at ensuring better regulatory and business environment and enhancing competitiveness of Slovenian economy – were implemented).</p>

<p>The number of individual e-buyers who made a purchase within the last 12 months grew by 6% annually between 2010 and 2015 to account for 39% of the population (aged 16-74).</p>

<p>Slovenia is expected to launch the use of the “SME test” in 2016, meaning every new law will have to be appraised based on the impact it will have on businesses, SMEs in particular.</p>

<p>Not to sugarcoat those opportunities – every one of the markets has its drawbacks and threats able to impair future prosperity. Even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/23/the-dream-of-polish-tech-entrepreneurship-is-almost-over/">leading CEE markets have controversial processes in place</a>, requiring careful assessment of the best choice should one decide to go on a CEE quest. High barriers for entry in certain countries, ageing society, corruption, significant rural population are among important downsides to local economies. Nonetheless, CEE is expected to emerge from local problems to a region with highly cooperative and supportive governments (which many already are), strong and open to collaboration banks, powered by an insignificant competition, up to the moment when the hype grinds down every aspect of CEE nations to shed light for the international community on their next place to be.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <h2 id="africa--the-market-of-unexplored-opportunities">Africa – the market of unexplored opportunities</h2>

<p>Although Africa is considered to be the largest unserved market that has dropped out of sight of the global financial system, there are segments in its financial services industry that is highly advanced in terms of the adoption scale and attractiveness to entrants. For instance, remittance via mobile has picked up a rapid pace in Africa, with Kenyans already using mobile money services for over eight years.
As a market, Africa has all the prerequisites to serve as a firm foundation for growth and development. Among the key data points characterizing Africa’s financial system, as outlined by the SWIFT Institute, are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Both banks and nonbanks are allowed to provide mobile money services in 47 out of the 89 markets where mobile money is available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Half of almost 300 million registered accounts of mobile money globally are located in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, there are 2.26 million mobile money agents in developing countries around the world, a figure that is more than the number of alternative financial access points comprising ATMs (1.38 million), commercial bank branches (524,000), post offices (501,000) and Western Union locations (500,000).
In the face of an outstanding opportunity presented in Africa, an ecosystem of FinTech startups providing services across segments has grown to transform the financial services industry in that continent for inclusive growth (with the support of dedicated accelerators and incubators). In this overview, we will be focusing on Nigeria – one of the most promising economies for entrepreneurs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="nigeria-has-an-opportunity-to-establish-itself-as-one-of-the-hottest-fintech-hubs">Nigeria has an opportunity to establish itself as one of the hottest FinTech hubs</h2>

<p>Professionals emphasize significant FinTech opportunities in Nigeria that could potentially redefine the financial services landscape over the next five years.
'The fast growing young population (115 million people below the age of 35), exponential growth of mobile phone lines (estimated at 150 million as at July 2016), huge financial inclusion potential (less than 50 million people with bank accounts in a population of 170 million people, based on Bank Verification Number [BVN] data) and relatively strong talent pool (buoyed by Nigerians in diaspora) are pertinent indicators of the FinTech opportunity,’ as noted by Boye Ademola, Partner, KPMG US.</p>

<p>Some of the important highlights on the opportunities in Nigeria’s financial services industry, as observed by industry professionals, include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Predominantly cash-driven Nigerian economy has been responding well to the FinTech opportunity. This is partly demonstrated by the exponential growth in mobile money operations from an average monthly transaction value of $5 million in 2011 to $142.8 million in 2016. The growing FinTech penetration is attributed to a surge in e-commerce and smartphone penetration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>FinTech investment in Africa has increased significantly from $198 million in 2014 to ~$800 million in 2016, as investors are increasingly attracted to the industry’s potential to tap into Africa’s huge unserved/underserved population. Investments in Nigeria and Africa as a whole have been primarily focused on payment solutions, as other FinTech segments such as lending and wealth management, are in a relatively nascent stage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Smartphone penetration in Nigeria (i.e., the percentage of adults owning a smartphone) is estimated at 28%, with 76% of internet traffic routed through mobile phones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The payment space is one of the most attractive segments for FinTechs in Nigeria, and it has become a key source of revenue for banks and other payment service providers. As part of its Payments Systems Vision (PSV) initiative to reform the payment industry, the Federal Government of Nigeria launched the cashless Nigeria policy giving rise to several innovative payment systems propelled by changing consumer patterns, rising adoption of smartphones, increased internet penetration, and deployment of ATMs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A strong talent pipeline of inexpensive and easy-to-hire tech workforce is one of the driving forces behind the emergence of FinTechs in Nigeria.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About 70% of Nigerian traders own a mobile phone. Findings also show that 74% of them are prepared to learn a new technology and that over 30% have been denied access to credit from a financial institution. Also important is that 56% of the traders survey source funds from families, friends, and unions; over 60% require funds less than N30,000.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the size of annual diaspora remittances to Nigeria estimated at $21 billion in 2015, this country is one area prone to disruption from digital currencies given the speed, efficiency and cost benefits of the latter. For instance, Bitcoin remittance firms charge fees in the range of 3% compared to the 7-10% commission charged by traditional players.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While blockchain is in its early stages of adoption in Nigeria, consumers have used Bitcoin and digital currencies since the late 2000s. The Bitcoin Market Potential Index (BMPI) by the London School of Economics ranked Nigeria 7th out of 178 countries likely to adopt Bitcoin.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the Global Findex report, in Nigeria, 80% of adults paid utility bills with cash, while 15% made payments directly from a financial institution account. What’s more, another 1% of users reported that they paid their utility bills both from a financial institution account and through a mobile phone—in all cases from a mobile money account.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the past few years, there has been steady progress in improving financial inclusion in Nigeria. It is estimated that about 40% of Nigerians are still financially excluded as the 2020 target of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is 20%.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Nigerian customer evolves, banks are leveraging new technologies to improve the banking customer experience since more and more financial transactions are now conducted via digital channels. In February 2014, the CBN through the Bankers’ Committee and in collaboration with all banks in Nigeria launched a centralized biometric identification system also known as Bank Verification Number (BVN) for the banking industry. Today, all P2P lenders depend on BVN in addition to other information for operating their lending models.</p>

                    <p>Despite the ever-growing number of <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/">payments service providers</a>, the payment experience itself will inevitably fade away into history (more precisely, become a back-end operation).

<p>Emphasizing <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/understand-future-of-financial-services-industry/">the role of outsiders in transforming the financial services industry</a>, we encountered a few curious developments that have been assertively moving B2B, B2C &amp; C2C interactions beyond the payment and the physical interactive interface overall, fading away transactional experiences to focus on the goal of interaction with a customer. More interestingly, neither financial institutions nor <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/">the FinTech startup community</a> are the main trendsetters in this movement away from focusing on the payments stage of any exchange.</p>

<h2 id="payment-is-not-the-goal-neither-is-it-a-final-stage-of-b2b-b2c-and-c2c-interactions">Payment is not the goal, neither is it a final stage of B2B, B2C, and C2C interactions</h2>

<p>It’s not the payment itself that constitutes a successful interaction of any business with its clients; it’s the experience of the product/service that business offers. The payment is only a step toward connecting people with one another, and with brands, rather than a self-sufficient activity and value. So, where are we really with invisible payments and fading transactional experiences?</p>

<h3 id="shopping-without-the-payment">Shopping without the payment</h3>

<p>Amazon is one of the companies that came razor-thin close to bringing the idea of a payment-less shopping experience into reality with its concept of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=16008589011">Amazon Go</a> store. The idea is to eliminate the whole part of standing in lines to make a payment as the payment experience itself is removed from the most payment-centered activity – <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/top-ways-online-retailers-can-make-shopping-safer-this-holiday-season/">shopping</a>.</p>

<p>Amazon Go’s Just Walk Out Technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When the customer is done shopping, he/she can just leave the store. Shortly after, Amazon charges the customer’s Amazon account and sends a receipt.</p>

<h3 id="payment-less-dining">Payment-less dining</h3>

<p>Another payment-less experience has been introduced for a dining affair by <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/07/12/taobao-china-store/#fKMiJZ.rDaq3">Tao Cafe by Taobao</a>. Guests can scan their smartphones at the door, grab what they need, and after they step out, the bill will be automatically sent to their smartphones. Tao Cafe <a href="http://www.nylon.com.sg/2017/07/we-saw-the-future-of-retail-in-this-taobao-cafe.html">was actually a pop-up at the Taobao Maker Festival</a>, created to showcase the Alibaba Group’s “cashier-less” retail experience.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.nylon.com.sg/2017/07/we-saw-the-future-of-retail-in-this-taobao-cafe.html">explained by Nylon</a>, the cashier-less experience starts with the customer opening the Taobao app on his smartphone and using it to scan a QR code at the Tao Cafe entrance, which then generates an electronic pass to grant him entry into the store. He can pick up whatever he wants to purchase in the store; and to check out, all he has to do is walk through a payment corridor that automatically detects the items and deducts the cost from the customer’s Alipay account.</p>

<p>As for the cafe portion, the edition <a href="http://www.nylon.com.sg/2017/07/we-saw-the-future-of-retail-in-this-taobao-cafe.html">continues</a>; Alibaba has removed the need for counter staff by basically powering the whole ordering process with voice and facial recognition. Customers can order their food and drinks just by saying what they want; the technology will process the order and deduct money from customers’ Alipay account automatically.</p>

<p>Facebook and Apple are putting all their eggs in a basket that has nothing to do with mobile, previously <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/future-of-financial-services-mobile-and-instant/">considered to be the future of the financial services</a>. Facebook is <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-next-big-thing-augmented-reality-mark-zuckerberg-2017-4">now betting its future on augmented reality</a>, the nascent technology that promises to overlay virtual information onto the real world and eventually replace smartphones with something like a pair of glasses or even contact lenses.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Apple, at the company’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC 2017</a>, outlined an interesting trend that could bury smartphones in the next 10 years, making any mobile payment developments irrelevant.</p>

<p>“Augmented reality – this is going to be the new operating system and that was the big news at WWDC,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gene-munster-0710439/">Gene Munster</a>, Apple Analyst and Founder of <a href="http://loupventures.com/">Loup Ventures</a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2017/06/06/how-apple-may-kill-smartphone-in-10-years-gene-munster.html">said to</a> FOX Business’ Stuart Varney. Munster, considered one of the top Apple watchers, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2017/06/06/how-apple-may-kill-smartphone-in-10-years-gene-munster.html">added</a>, “[It] is going to change how we interact and it is eventually going to replace the smartphone. Think of the smartphone eventually going away in the next 10 years. That is the next wave.”</p>

                    <h2 id="the-payments-ecosystem">The Payments Ecosystem</h2>

<p>The Evolution of Channels and Means</p>

<p>Money and the idea of its exchange through payments have evolved a lot from the time of its inception. From goods to grain, from metal coins to paper, from bank accounts to e-wallets, money has taken various shapes, sizes, and forms. Payments evolved from a barter system (exchange of goods for grains) to the token system (exchange of coins and cash on paper) to cash pooling (bank accounts and deposits) to cashless payments (credit cards, checks, e-wallets). Over the last decade or so, payment technologies have grown at a dizzying pace.</p>

<p>Payments are now evolving at a rapid pace with new providers, new platforms, and new payment tools launching on a near daily basis. As consumer behavior evolves, an expectation of omnicommerce emerges – that is the ability to pay with the same method whether buying in-store, online or via a mobile device. This shift precipitates a need for retailers to adapt toward fast, simple and secure mobile payments.</p>

<p>The payments industry would be in a transformational state in 2017. The ongoing war with alternative payment channels will intensify and challenges in emerging markets would force the incumbents to take drastic measures. Some key drivers would be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Real-Time Payments: RTP represents a new phase of evolution within the payments industry, with several key features that differentiate them from current payment methods, specifically speed, value-added messaging capabilities and immediate availability of transaction status. RTP will provide FIs with the functionality/features to innovate and meet customer demand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)/Blockchain: Blockchain has the potential to completely change the financial transaction processing cost model amongst its various applications. It also enables all processing to be done over a distributed system network or in the cloud, avoiding the usage of costly data centers or mainframes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expansion of Payments to Non-Physical Interfaces: Traditional interfaces are challenged by external stakeholders (Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple) in two ways – voice assistants and VR. Connected assistants become smarter and add functionality with the enhancement of NLP and image recognition. Betting on physical interfaces, and mobile, in particular, can no longer ensure long-term relevance as voice-first solutions evolve. WithFacebook obsessed on killing the smartphone to own a virtual space, classic interfaces and solutions developed for them will gradually fall out of grace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unified Platforms: The first Visa/Mastercard/SWIFT-free payments system – the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) by NPCI was launched in 2016. UPI is an open-source platform designed for the mobile age that helps with easy integration of various payment platforms. UPI is powered by a single payment API and a set of supporting APIs. UPI offers a whole new model of the financial services industry ecosystem. UPI became a starting point of what SWIFT called a journey to a single payments platform. UPI is a benchmark to what the payments landscape should be moving towards given that oversaturated payments ecosystem, where too many ‘pay’s’ won’t let anyone win. Disjoint experiences across businesses create customer confusion, and, at the end, with a limited customer base, limit opportunities for every payment service provider – existing and new. Professionals from SWIFT emphasize that the payments industry must migrate from a plethora of aging and expensive systems and schemes to a single platform to process all payments. However, a single payment experience for customers (based on seamless system interoperability, comparable to mobile telephony) is a more probable future than a single payments platform.</p>

<p>Participants</p>

<p>Source: Overview of the Payments Ecosystem – Electronic Transactions Association</p>

<p>Channels</p>

<p>Here are three main payment channels based on market participants and underlying funding mechanisms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>B2C</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>C2C</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>B2B</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Regulation, demographics, and technology are affecting B2C and B2B in various ways. Technology is most actively shaping C2C payments while B2C and C2B have not been left behind with technology partnerships mushrooming across banks, enterprises, and startups. C2C payments have the highest potential to evolve as a result of several factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Convenience and ease of use</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lack of “entrenched” counterparties such as businesses, which are typically much slower to adopt new business processes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lack of “stickiness” for incumbent service providers such as offers and rewards</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Processors for the payment systems can use different channels to make a payment and each has different operating characteristics, rules and settlement mechanisms. All payment systems can be broadly placed into one of the following payment channels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Paper-Based systems such as checks or drafts. Payments are initiated when one party writes an instruction on paper to pay another. These systems are one of the oldest forms of non-cash payment systems. Checks are a common paper-based channel and are still widely used in the United States and a few other countries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) or High-Value Payments, commonly called wire transfers. Wires came into being in the late 1800s with the invention of the telegraph but did not become widely used until the early 1900s.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RTNS, or Real Time Net Settlement systems or Automated Clearing House (ACH) batch payments were introduced in the early 1970s and were designed to replace checks with electronic payments. Unlike wires, which are processed individually, ACH payments are processed in batches and were originally intended for small payments under $100,000 such as payroll and consumer transactions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cards are a payment channel that includes credit, debit and stored value cards. They are a fast growing segment of the methods for making and receiving payments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mobile payment is defined as the use of mobile phone to pay for the purchase of goods and services at a retail POS terminal or on the Internet. Payment may be initiated via SMS text message, mobile browser, downloadable app, contactless near-field communication (NFC), or quick response (QR) code. As more and more smartphone owners use their devices to pay for products online, mobile payment services are predicted to grow rapidly. At the same time, the emergence of one-touch checkout buttons, P2P payments and the rise of sharing economies have created new opportunities for remote mobile payments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Real-Time Low-value payments provide consumers and businesses with the ability to conveniently send and receive immediate fund transfers directly from their accounts at FIs, anytime 24/7/365. Financial institutions can leverage a variety of features – enhanced speed, security, and messaging capabilities – to create unique offerings for their retail and corporate customers. RTP also provides a backbone on which new business models can be redefined.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Payments Schemes</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Pay-2.png" alt="Pay-2.png" /></p>

<p>Source: What does the payment ecosystem look like?, Ecommerce Foundation</p>

<p>OBeP Scheme</p>

<p>The Online Banking ePayments (OBeP) scheme is a type of payments network, developed by the local or international banking industry – in conjunction with technology providers – designed to facilitate online bank transfers or direct debits.</p>

<p>In an OBeP scheme, the consumer is authenticated in real-time by the consumer’s financial institution’s online banking infrastructure. The availability of funds is validated in real-time and the consumer’s financial institution provides a guarantee of the payment to the merchant in case the payment is made as a credit transfer (push payment): the consumer/buyer initiates the payment. In case the merchant initiates the payment – a debit transfer (pull payment) – the consumer is protected from wrong debits and has the right to reverse the payment depending on scheme regulation and market legislation.</p>

<p>OBeP schemes often allow for direct merchant integration and do guarantee the payment to merchants. Other benefits are the relatively low transaction cost compared to card, wallet or other alternative payments.</p>

<p>OBeP Types</p>

<p>Across markets, there are several OBeP scheme types to distinguish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mono-Bank OBeP Scheme: Entails that a seller or Payment Service Provider has a separate connection to each participating financial institution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Multi-Bank OBeP Scheme: Entails that a seller or Payment Service Provider has one single connection to the OBeP network in order to accept payment from any participating financial institution (Ex.: the iDEAL scheme in the Netherlands and BankAxess in Norway)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overlay OBeP Scheme: Similar to the Multi-Bank or Mono-Bank scheme, however, there is a third party (the overlay provider) who sits between the payment network and the consumer. The overlay provider requires the consumer to share their online banking credentials with them in order to have access to the consumer’s bank account and to initiate the credit transfer to the merchant. (e.g. SOFORT banking, or SOFORT Überweisung)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Three-Party Model</p>

<p>A three-party scheme consists of three main parties whereby the issuer – who has the relationship with the cardholder – and the acquirer – who has the relationship with the merchant – is the same entity. The three parties consist of the consumer, the merchant and the scheme.</p>

<p>Often the three-party model is a franchise set-up, whereby there is only one franchisee in the market. There is no competition within the brand; however, there is competition with other card brands and other alternative payment methods. Some examples of three-party card schemes: Diners Club International, Discover, and American Express.</p>

<p>In the last few years, these schemes have also partnered with other issuers and acquirers to ensure issuance and acceptance of their card brand. These schemes could be seen as ‘premium’ card schemes as they tend to have strong cardholder focus and to provide additional privileges for cardholders. Merchants are often charged a relatively high merchant commission rate.</p>

<p>Four-Party Model</p>

<p>In a four-party scheme, the issuer – who has the relationship with the cardholder – and the acquirer, who has the relationship with the merchant, are different entities. The four parties consist of the consumer, the merchant, the issuer and the acquirer. These four-party schemes are referred to as ‘open schemes’ as they allow banks and financial institutions to join, to start issuing their cards and/or to acquire merchants for card acceptance. In principle, there is no limitation to who may join the scheme, as long as the scheme requirements are met. Some examples of a three-party card scheme: Mastercard, Visa, Maestro, UnionPay, JCB and RuPay (India).</p>

<p>The four-party model is known for its interchange fee revenue model. The interchange fee is a fee – fixed or a percentage of the transaction – that is paid by the acquirer to the applicable issuer. The interchange fee represents a major share in the total commission charged to merchants.</p>

<p>SEPA Payments Scheme</p>

<p>The single euro payments area (SEPA) harmonizes the way cashless euro payments are made across Europe. It allows European consumers, businesses, and public administrations to make and receive the following types of transactions under the same basic conditions (credit transfers, direct debit payments, card payments). This makes all cross-border electronic payments in euro as easy as domestic payments. SEPA covers the whole of the EU. It also applies to payments in euros in other European countries: Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino.</p>

<p>The advantages of the SEPA Scheme include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A single system for both domestic and cross-border bank transfers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allowing cross-border transactions by direct debit, that is to charge directly an account in one country for services provided in another country</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allowing people working or studying in another SEPA country to use an existing account in their home country to receive their salary or pay bills in the new country</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensuring cheaper, safer and faster cross-border payments and more transparent pricing thanks to the single set of payment schemes and standards</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>SEPA is a collaborative process. The SEPA project was launched by the European banking and payment industry represented by the European Payments Council (EPC). The EPC has designed the SEPA schemes for credit transfers and direct debits, and is developing a scheme for payment cards. It is also currently working on a new framework for mobile payments. The principle of equal charges both for national and cross-border payments applies to all electronically processed payments in euros – including credit transfers, direct debits, withdrawals at cash dispensers (ATMs), payments by debit and credit cards, and money remittance.</p>

<p>Countries outside the euro area may also extend the application of this regulation to their national currency. The SEPA vision is one of a harmonized European-wide standard payments environment using mandatory and consistent ISO 20022 XML messaging. Eventually, it will bring significant savings to companies by driving down transaction costs and cross-border charging practices.</p>

<p>Further benefits include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A reduction in the number of bank accounts needed to do business across Europe</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Faster settlements and simplified processing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increased transparency of pricing and fees</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Potential for the centralization of accounts and payment flows</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="processes--how-transactions-work">Processes – How Transactions Work</h2>

<p>Payments transactions are processed through a variety of platforms, including brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce stores, wireless terminals, and phone or mobile devices. The entire cycle usually takes place within two to three seconds.</p>

<p>We will use a credit card payment as a model to demonstrate each step in the transaction process, which includes the following participants:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cardholder: There are two types of cardholders: a “transactor” who repays the credit card balance in full and a “revolver” who repays only a portion of the balance while the rest accrues interest. Merchant: This is the store or vendor who sells goods or services to the cardholder. The merchant accepts credit card payments. It also sends card information to and requests payment authorization from the cardholder’s issuing bank.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acquiring Bank/Merchant’s Bank: The acquiring bank is responsible for receiving payment authorization requests from the merchant and sending them to the issuing bank through the appropriate channels. It then relays the issuing bank’s response to the merchant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acquiring Processor/Service Provider: This third-party entity is sometimes an arm of the acquiring bank. A processor provides a service or device that allows merchants to accept credit cards as well as send credit card payment details to the credit card network. It then forwards the payment authorization back to the acquiring bank.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Credit card Network/Association Member: These entities operate the networks that process credit card payments worldwide and govern interchange fees. Examples of credit card networks are Visa, Mastercard, Discover and American Express. In the transaction process, a credit card network receives the credit card payment details from the acquiring processor. It forwards the payment authorization request to the issuing bank and sends the issuing bank’s response to the acquiring processor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Issuing Bank/Credit Card Issuer: This is the financial institution that issued the credit card involved in the transaction. It receives the payment authorization request from the credit card network and either approves or declines the transaction.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Stage 1: Authorization</p>

<p>In the authorization stage, the merchant must obtain approval for payment from the issuing bank.</p>

<p>The cardholder presents their credit card for payment to the merchant at the point-of-sale (POS).</p>

<p>After swiping their credit card at a POS terminal, the customer’s credit card details are sent to the acquiring bank (or its acquiring processor).</p>

<p>The acquiring bank or processor forwards the credit card details to the credit card network.</p>

<p>The credit card network clears the payment and requests payment authorization from the issuing bank. The authorization request includes the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Credit card number</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Card expiration date</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Billing address – for Address Verification System (AVS) validation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Card security code – CVV</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Payment amount</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Stage 2: Authentication</p>

<p>In the authentication stage, the issuing bank verifies the validity of the customer’s credit card using fraud protection tools such as the Address Verification Service (AVS) and card security codes such as CVV, CVV2, CVC2, and CID.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The issuing bank receives the payment authorization request from the credit card network.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issuing bank validates the credit card number, checks the amount of available funds, matches the billing address to the one on file and validates the CVV number.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issuing bank approves or declines the transaction and sends back the appropriate response to the merchant through the same channels: credit card network and acquiring bank or processor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the merchant receives authorization, the issuing bank will place a hold on the amount of the purchase on the cardholder’s account. The merchant’s POS terminal will collect all approved authorizations to be processed in a “batch” at the end of the business day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The merchant provides the customer a receipt to complete the sale.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/uploads/pay-4.png" alt="pay-4.png" /></p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://wallethub.com/edu/credit-card-transaction/25511/">How Credit Card Transaction Processing Works: Steps, Fees &amp; Participants</a></p>

<p>Stage 3: Clearing and Settlement</p>

<p>In the clearing stage, the transaction is posted to both the cardholder’s monthly credit card billing statement and the merchant’s statement. It occurs simultaneously with the settlement stage.</p>

<p>At the end of each business day, the merchant sends the approved authorizations in a batch to the acquiring bank or processor.</p>

<p>The acquiring processor routes the batched information to the credit card network for settlement.</p>

<p>The credit card network forwards each approved transaction to the appropriate issuing bank.</p>

<p>Usually, within 24 to 48 hours of the transaction, the issuing bank will transfer the funds less an “interchange fee,” which it shares with the credit card network.</p>

<p>The credit card network pays the acquiring bank and the acquiring processor their respective percentages from the remaining funds.</p>

<p>The acquiring bank credits the merchant’s account for cardholder purchases, less a “merchant discount rate.”</p>

<p>The issuing bank posts the transaction information to the cardholder’s account. The cardholder receives the statement and pays the bill.</p>

<h2 id="fees-and-costs">Fees and Costs</h2>

<p>Depending on the type of merchant and through which platform a good or service is delivered, credit card processing rates will vary. They usually are charged as flat fees, per-transaction fees or volume-based fees. The major costs include:</p>

<p>Merchant Discount Rate: <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/crossing-borders-ecommerce-merchants-their-payments-challenges/">Merchants</a> pay this fee for accepting credit card payments and receiving service from acquiring processors. It’s usually between 2% and 3% (online merchants pay the higher end) – to as much as 5% – of the total purchase price after sales tax is added. Also known as a discount fee, this rate comprises several components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Interchange Fee: The acquiring bank and acquiring processor pay this fee to the issuing bank. It is market-based and set by each credit card network. Most interchange fees are assessed in two parts: a percentage to the issuing bank and a fixed transaction fee to the credit card network. Interchange fees vary and are categorized through a process called “interchange qualification,” which determines the rate based on several criteria: Physical presence or absence of the card during the transaction; Processing method used (e.g., swiped, manually entered or e-commerce); Credit card company; Card type (e.g., regular, premium, commercial, rewards or government-issued); Merchant’s business type (as determined by merchant category code).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assessments: Credit card networks (except American Express) charge this fee for transactions that are made with their branded cards. It usually is based on a percentage of the total transaction volume for the month. The fee usually is fixed, and the merchant’s acquiring bank may not charge a lower rate or negotiate a better deal with the merchant. Assessments generally are charged per transaction but can vary depending on the pricing model the merchant follows. Assessment amounts may change periodically. Combined with the interchange fee, assessments constitute between 75% and 80% of total card-processing costs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Markups: Acquiring banks and acquiring processors usually will include a markup over interchange fees and assessments partly as profit and partly to cover the cost of facilitating credit card transactions. It constitutes between 20% and 25% of total card-processing costs. Merchants generally can negotiate the markup with the entities that charge them. Markups vary by processor and pricing model. They may also include other types of fees.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/tips-to-avoid-chargeback/">Chargebacks</a>: Customers reserve the right to dispute a charge on their credit card billing statement within 60 days of the statement date. When the issuing bank receives a complaint from a customer, it charges the merchant between $10 and $50 as a penalty and for issuing a “retrieval request.” If the merchant doesn’t respond to the retrieval request within a certain timeframe, it could incur additional fees. The merchant may appeal, but the process is long and likely to favor the customer. If the merchant loses, the issuing bank will recover, or chargeback, the customer’s payment.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-payments-onlinedigital-and-offline">Types of Payments: Online/Digital and Offline</h2>

<p>Offline Payments</p>

<p>The Definition</p>

<p>An offline transaction, also known as a signature debit transaction, is a payment method that uses a debit card to transfer funds from a checking account to a merchant across a digital credit card network.</p>

<p>How It Works</p>

<p>When a cardholder pays for goods or services with a debit card, he/she has an option to process the payment in one of two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>as an offline transaction via a credit card processing network, or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as an online transaction via an electronic funds transfer (EFT) system</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Offline Transactions Are Processed Much Like Credit Card Transactions</p>

<p>They are sent over one of the major credit card networks – Visa, Mastercard, Discover, etc. – depending on which credit card network the bank is associated with as a member bank. The cost of the transaction, called an “interchange fee,” is charged to the vendor/merchant rather than the bank.</p>

<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/mobile-payments-can-transform-shopping-habits/">Mobile payments</a> in offline mode are gaining popularity among consumers. With offline mode, consumers can make mobile payments when Internet service is temporarily unavailable. Offline payments are processed automatically when the device regains connectivity.</p>

<p>Making mobile payments in offline mode involves three distinct stages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Prepayment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Making the payment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Post-payment</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Users are required to set funds for offline payments in advance to make use of the offline mode of mobile payments. The fund limit can be set in prepayments stage along with expiry and number of transactions limit and it also enables the user to restrict the locations for the use of offline funds. For making payment in the offline mode, consumers can connect smartphone devices with retail <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/wanted-unified-contactless-kernel-at-pos/">POS terminals</a> using Bluetooth or <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/nfc-payments-are-picking-up-in-developed-economies-but-emerging-economies-are-different/">NFC</a> means. Once the balance details are confirmed, the payment system processes the transaction in offline mode.</p>

<p>Major players in the mobile payments industry are coming up with offline mobile payments solutions for in-store payments. Leading players in the mobile payments industry like Square and Google Wallet provides offline mobile payments option for its users to make in-store payments.</p>

<h2 id="revenue-models">Revenue Models</h2>

<p>Transactional</p>

<p>Interchange Reimbursement Fees and Assessments: The fees the card-issuing banks and the credit card associations charge for each transaction. They represent the largest expense merchants (should) pay per sale and per month.</p>

<p>Interchange fees typically consist of a % of each transaction accompanied by a flat per transaction fee. Assessments are typically based on a % of the total transaction volume for the month.</p>

<p>Examples of these non-negotiable interchange and assessment merchant account fees include: Merit 1/e-commerce/CNP fees, NABU/APF/data usage fees, dues, and assessments.</p>

<p>Each card association publishes their interchange and assessment fees online.</p>

<p>Note: These are the wholesale rates. With the interchange-plus pricing structure, the processor will quote a markup – the amount the processor will add to the wholesale rates. On a tiered pricing plan, the quote will be with the Qualified, Mid-Qualified, and Non-Qualified rates. Those quotes have the margin baked right into the quote, thus making it more difficult to tell what the processor’s margin is.</p>

<p>Flat Fees</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Terminal Fees: Charged to merchants who have physical stores, where they directly swipe a customer’s card.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Payment Gateway Fees: Similar to terminal fees, but they are applied to e-commerce businesses instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PCI Fees: The fees paid to the Payment Card Industry, either for noncompliance or compliance assurance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Annual Fees: The fees charged every year to cover the basic use of a provider’s services.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Early Termination Fees: The fee that is charged in case of early cancellation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Monthly Fees: The fees that are charged each month, usually for the purpose of covering call center costs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Monthly Minimum Fees: The fees charged to merchants who do not reach a certain transaction total for the month or year. The minimums vary by provider.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Statement Fees: The fees charged to cover printing and mailing costs for credit card statements. Can be bypassed with electronic bill statements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>IRS Report Fees: The fees that merchant account providers charge in exchange for reporting transaction information to the IRS (1099-K).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Online Reporting: Alternatives to statement fees. Charged to merchants who choose to view their statements online.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Network Fees: The card networks charge certain non-negotiable fees that are passed through to the merchant, such as the Fixed Acquirer Network Fee (FANF).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Incidental Fees</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Address Verification Service (AVS): E-commerce/telephone order businesses are charged AVS fee per every transaction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Voice Authorization Fee (VAF): A fee charged for verification of certain information before a transaction is authorized. Made through a call to a toll-free number.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Retrieval Request Fee: Every time a customer initiates a dispute on a charge from the business, it sets into motion the chargeback protocol. The fee covers any expense related to the retrieval request.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chargeback Fee: After the retrieval request, the actual chargeback may occur depending on the circumstances. If it does, there is a fee on top of losing the money from the sale.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Batch Fee: Every time the business submits a batch of transactions, a batch fee (or batch header) is charged.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NSF Fee: If the business doesn’t have enough funds in its bank account to cover merchant account expenses, it will be assessed an NSF (non-sufficient funds) fee.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="consumer-and-retail-payments">Consumer and Retail Payments</h2>

<p>Society as a whole is using less of the physical monetary medium, and more businesses are adapting by accepting credit and debit cards. The payments market is changing from cash to checks, from cards to online payments to payments using mobile devices. Businesses that didn’t accept credit cards a few years ago are now embracing the change to speed up the payments cycle and maintain or grow their customer base. Now you can even pay your rent, taxes, and monthly bills via credit cards. It’s predicted that by 2025, <a href="https://financialit.net/blog/mobile-payments/payment-trends-2017-will-mobile-payments-be-game-changer">75%</a> of all transactions will be made without cash. Mobile payment applications and <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/how-mobile-banking-wins-loyalty-small-businesses/">mobile banking</a> are increasing in popularity, which is indicative of consumers’ willingness to use smart devices and cards.</p>

<p>Payments are now evolving at a rapid pace with new providers, new platforms, and new payment tools launching on a near daily basis. As consumer behavior evolves, an expectation of omnicommerce emerges – that is the ability to pay with the same method whether buying in-store, online or via a mobile device. This shift precipitates a need for retailers to adapt toward fast, simple and secure mobile payments.</p>

<p>Mobile payments are defined as the use of mobile phone to pay for the purchase of goods and services at a retail point-of-sale (POS) terminal or on the Internet. Payment may be initiated via SMS text message, mobile browser, downloadable app, contactless near field communication (NFC), or quick response (QR) code. As more and more smartphone owners use their devices to pay for products online, mobile payment services such as Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay are predicted to grow rapidly. At the same time, the emergence of one-touch checkout buttons, peer-to-peer payments and the rise of sharing economies have created new opportunities for remote mobile payments.</p>

<p>The Rise of Mobile Payments</p>

<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/can-smartphone-manufacturers-win-the-mobile-payments-race/">Smartphone</a> penetration and mobile operating system market share are key indicators of potential mobile payment adoption. Smartphones have enabled consumers to connect to different channels, making it easy for consumers to use mobile devices for payments. Another key driver of mobile payment adoption is the growth of mobile commerce.</p>

<p>Various industry stakeholders, including card networks, financial institutions and merchants <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/mobile-payments-programs-are-on-the-rise-among-major-market-participants/">have shown heightened interest in the growing mobile payments industry</a> – through launching proprietary solutions or enabling third-party players. Stakeholders are trying to adapt as quickly as the technology developments evolve. Startups and incumbents from the financial services industry and technology providers are developing new services that are helping to shape consumer preferences.</p>

<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/mobile-wallets-when-too-many-pays-wont-let-anyone-win/">Mobile Wallets</a>: Consumers see the mobile wallet as a next-generation payment option. The technology offers ease of pay using an electronic wallet and avoids the use of cards or cash. Many countries are moving toward a near field communication (NFC) payment structure, which would allow consumers to pay for goods by moving smartphones within a few inches of a payment device through mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet. Mobile wallet initiatives are taken up by banks, telecom companies, financial technology providers and also governments across the globe. Nearly 78% of US consumers are aware of mobile wallet capabilities and 32% of US consumers use a mobile wallet such as Apple Pay or Android Pay.</p>

<p>Increased Security: The adoption of chip and signature-chip cards does not go far enough towards reducing the impact of credit card fraud. Most of the mobile payments apps generate a unique barcode for each transaction instead of sharing card details with the merchant and the merchant’s bank. Both Apple Pay and Google Wallet, among many others, require unlocking through a second factor of authentication (Ex.: <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/wearable-technology-will-accelerate-the-adoption-of-biometric-technology/">biometric</a> or PIN).</p>

<p>Ease of Use: Compared to chip-and-signature cards, mobile transactions could speed up the checkout process which is beneficial for both consumers and merchants. For mobile payments, the phone is a proxy for a card. One can enter credit or debit card details in a mobile app ahead of time and use it anywhere for making payments or one can use a mobile payment app at a store and have the cashier to scan it for payment or consumers can tap “phone” on the pad for NFC payments. Mobile payments simply provide different ways of executing transactions at different locations.</p>

<p>Mobile Payments – Challenges</p>

<p>Mobile payments are gaining momentum (mobile P2P payments in the US only are forecasted to grow to nearly $175 billion by 2019), yet still represent a small portion of total consumer payments. The main barriers to consumer adoption are security and privacy concerns. It is critical for new mobile payments schemes to address this issue and earn consumers’ trust from the start with secure schemes and straightforward use cases.</p>

<p>Aside from privacy and security concerns, one of the key challenges presently facing the mobile payments market is the high level of market fragmentation defined both by the multiplicity of platforms/solutions technologies being deployed and the increasing range of service configurations being offered. This slows down merchant acceptance and makes it difficult for providers to gain scale.</p>

<p>While security and POS compatibility are the major concerns for the expansion of mobile payments market, the industry is gaining momentum with key players and financial institutions coming up with new and innovative strategies like including additional store and loyalty cards giving consumers more reasons to ditch physical wallets.</p>

<p>Mobile Payments – Opportunities</p>

<p>Due to adoption challenges resulting from high fragmentation, the market will reach a point where consolidation among players and solutions becomes the best way to drive address adoption issues.</p>

<p>Value-added models are becoming popular in the mobile payments arena. Companies are starting to monetize data-driven campaigns engines. Some of the value-added offerings take the form of white-label applications development for vertical industries. This type of model is expected to proliferate given the benefits it brings to all parties.</p>

<p>The key to successful m-payment applications is the ability to make them pervasive, so users grow to rely on them. Partnerships with ecosystem participants from all sectors (banks, retail, service providers and public sector) are essential to building a ubiquitous network of acceptance points. In addition, having a well-defined pipeline of compelling use cases is key for mobile payment providers to leverage the ecosystem to grow their user base and drive transaction volume.</p>

<p>Mobile point-of-sale (<a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/32-hottest-mpos-focused-companies/">mPOS</a>) startups like Square have pioneered a whole new payments niche – accepting payments via tablets and smartphones. Coupling their transactions capabilities with new apps can revolutionize a small business’ inventory management, marketing, loyalty, and payroll.</p>

<p>With smartphone usage on the rise and a plethora of mobile apps, consumers and businesses are using mobile devices in new and innovative ways. There is already a dynamic competitive environment for mobile banking, and now for mobile payments.</p>

<p>Mobile Payments – Key Players</p>

<p>Mobile payments is an evolution made possible by omnipresent mobile platforms and always-on Internet connections, fueled by companies like Square and Stripe, and propelled by Mastercard and Visa. Traditional credit card brands, online payment companies, carriers and <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/can-smartphone-manufacturers-win-the-mobile-payments-race/">smartphone manufacturers are all getting into the market</a> in various ways by joining to form coalitions, buying up mobile payment startups, and by providing innovative security solutions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Apple Pay: Launched in 2014 in the US, Apple Pay offers an easy, secure and private way to pay using iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple Pay is supported by 500+ banks in the US and it can be used in over a million stores which now accept contactless payments in the US. <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/is-apple-pay-leading-from-behind-again/">Apple Pay holds approximately 1% of the share of US retail transactions</a>. In June 2017 <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-11-preview/?&amp;cid=wwa-us-kwgo-features---slid-&amp;mnid=sWcJG3C2z-dc_mtid_20925e1t39169_pcrid_198753497450_&amp;muid=0b78cec6-209f-44b1-a118-d621b4db0529&amp;mtid=20925e1t39169&amp;aosid=p238">Apple Pay introduced a P2P payment service through iMessage with its iOS 11</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay works with all POS systems like near field communication (NFC), magnetic stripe and EMV terminals for chip-based cards. Samsung Pay does not store the account or credit card numbers of cards on the device; instead, it uses tokenization for transactions. Samsung Pay was launched in South Korea and the United States in 2015 and is giving tough competition to existing players in the market. The smartphone manufacturing company is all set to launch Samsung Pay in Australia, Brazil, Singapore, Spain, China and the United Kingdom in the first quarter of 2016.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Android Pay: Google’s Android Pay is a way to pay directly from the phone. Android Pay is the same tap-to-pay feature of Google Wallet, except Android Pay is built into the devices. It does not require any app installation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Google Wallet: <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/send-money-from-google-wallet-using-just-phone-number-in-minutes/">Google Wallet</a> also provides a P2P payment functionality wherein consumers can transfer money to friends and family over the Internet using Google Wallet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PayPal: PayPal is one of the safest and most convenient ways to perform monetary transactions online. Payments (money) can be sent in two ways: either as online purchases or personal payments; a transaction fee is applied to some transactions. Currently, more than 164 Million accounts are in use worldwide by Internet users who prefer to use PayPal to send money to each other via email or make online purchases. PayPal provides international peer-to-peer payment services to its users using its PayPal app.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>P2P Mobile Payments</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/p2p-payments-migration-from-apps-to-media-channels/">P2P Mobile Payments</a>: Globally, the market for peer-to-peer transfers and remittances is worth over $1 trillion. A new generation of apps makes transferring money faster, less expensive, and more precise. They also reduce the hassle of going to a money transfer agency, remembering a check book, or finding an ATM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 2013, Google launched Gmail integration with Google Wallet allowing users to send money through Gmail attachments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PayPal is one of the oldest and most established players in the online payments space and has a large, established user base. PayPal allows users to send money directly from a checking account, from a PayPal account balance or using credit and debit cards. Sending from a credit or debit card carries a fee of 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction, and the sender has the option of deciding which party pays this fee. Unlike any of the other peer-to-peer mobile money transfer services currently available in the US, PayPal allows users the ability to transfer funds internationally. Users can receive payments from 203 different countries and in 26 currencies and international transactions are subject to different fees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Snapchat, the photo-sharing app, has partnered with Square to allow its users to make payments through the app called Square Cash. Users can connect a Visa or MasterCard debit card to the account and send up to $250 per week and receive up to $1,000 per week (these numbers increase with time, use, and after proving one’s identity, as with other apps). Square Cash app does not charge fees and allows users to link a debit card to the account. The app also enables users to link directly to their bank account for fee-free transactions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Venmo is a streamlined, simple-to-use mobile payments app that can be downloaded for free on Android and iOS. Users can both send and request money simply by inputting the person’s name, the dollar amount, and a brief description of the transaction using Venmo. Users are able to receive money instantly through the app and transfers to bank accounts and transactions are processed within one business day.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Remittances</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cross-border payments have become a critical part of millions of lives as we have become a more globalized world. As cross-border payments have become more common, customers of remittance products/solutions are looking for the most convenient, cost-efficient and transparent options. Digital and mobile-based solutions, new cost-efficient models in the back-end and even the use of virtual currencies are being tried out by providers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 2015, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-role-of-mobile-money-in-democratizing-international-remittances-and-driving-financial-inclusion/">worldwide remittance flows</a> are estimated to have exceeded $601 billion. Of that amount, developing countries are estimated to receive about $441 billion, nearly three times the amount of official development assistance. The true size of remittances, including unrecorded flows through formal and informal channels, is believed to be significantly larger. High-income countries are the main source of remittances. The United States is by far the largest, with an estimated $56.3 billion in recorded outflows in 2014. Saudi Arabia ranks as the second largest, followed by the Russia, Switzerland, Germany, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. The six Gulf Cooperation Council countries accounted for $98 billion in outward remittance flows in 2014.</p>

<p>Online Remittances</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>New online players have emerged and have raised the bar in terms of customer experience (digital/mobile channel) and costs of remittance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost all major players successfully raised new funding rounds in the past six months: WorldRemit – $45M (total – $192,7M), TransferWise – $26M (total – $117M), Remitly – $38.5M (total – $61M), Azimo – $15M (previous round – $20M).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>High scope for mergers as customer acquisition is quite expensive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social remittance hasn’t picked up except WeChat.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Democratization of Remittances</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Non-bank market players in the financial services industry are disrupting almost every segment – the cross-border money transfer industry is one of those segments where traditional institutions have suffered significantly. In the UK, for example, the top 20 non-bank money transfer providers account for over £40 billion of foreign exchange per year, saving customers over £900 million annually.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>FinTech players like TransferWise and World First have <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/fintech-is-pushing-banks-out-of-the-remittance-business/">increased the pressure on banks in terms of fees for the transfer service</a>. Non-bank providers charge an average of 0.9% on £10,000, which is one-fourth of the average for banks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This outstanding achievement of FinTech could have had a significant impact on the situation with global remittance price reported by the World Bank. According to the data of Q4 2015, the average global cost of sending remittances fell to 7.37% as of December 2015, from 7.52% in the previous quarter. It’s possible to send money for the average cost of 10% or less in 80% of the world’s country corridors. For comparison, six years ago, only 50% of the corridors had the cost of 10% or less.</p>

</ul>

<p>The Cost of Sending Money to Different Regions</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The most meaningful change in Q4 2015 was a decline in the cost of sending remittances to the Middle East and North Africa region, which decreased from 8.37 to 7.42%.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At 5.43%, South Asia is still the least costly region to send money to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sub-Saharan Africa remains the most expensive region to send money to at 9.53%.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cash services remain the most widely available and one of the cheapest ways to send money at 6.54%.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Online products are the cheapest product type at 5.57%.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Account-to-account services remain the most expensive at 10.86%. However, the cost of transfer within the same bank or to a partner bank in the receiving country is significantly cheaper at 5.67%.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, global remittance is going through a positive change. There could be a variety of factors to that. However, with a certain confidence, it is impacted by the technological advancements within FinTech, and, blockchain technology, in particular. A significant number of banks are involved in relationships with FinTech companies in one way or another.</p>

<h2 id="microtransactions">Microtransactions</h2>

<p>In modern economic transactions where goods or services are transferred from a seller to a buyer, the payment commonly represents half of the transaction: the part used to provide compensation to the seller. The cost of doing transactions affects the structure and organization of the economy. If the cost of doing a particular type of transactions in the market is higher than doing them within an organization they will not occur in the market. Instead, these transactions will occur within companies or structures that will form and grow from being more efficient than the market. This now-established thinking began with the influential Nature of the Firm article by Ronald Coase in 1937.</p>

<p>In transaction cost economics, various origins of transaction costs are considered – such as the cost of finding the right product, price, and legal terms before making a trade. When parties engage in large or complex transactions the cost of payment is usually too small to be significant in this context. However, for microtransactions, transactions where the value is small, the cost of performing the payment can represent a major part of the transaction cost. A second, often-ignored cost for small transactions is the mental cost. This is the cognitive effort required by the buyer, and seller, to decide if an offered transaction is beneficial and the effort to perform the steps needed to make the payment. To conclude, if transaction costs are pushed low enough, small internet transactions can become useful and profitable in the open market. New business models will emerge and existing business models will need to change.</p>

<p>What Are Microtransactions (MTX)?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/global-microtransactions/">Microtransactions</a> occur when users purchase goods through micropayments, a commerce transaction involving a very small amount of money, usually on the order of a few cents or pennies. This small sum of money could be anything from game points, customer loyalty points, and digital coupons. In a typical microtransaction-based monetization model, consumers are allowed to use an application for free, but then pay for incremental in-app content using the application’s branded points or virtual currency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>App-based virtual coins, points, and tokens that can be used to fulfill microtransactions are experiencing rapid growth, thanks to the proliferation of mobile and social network games and applications. In the Microtransactions Monetization model, consumers are allowed to use the application for free and only pay for the in-app content they want by using application-branded points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The microtransactions (MTX) APIs offer a full suite of monetization solutions for online and mobile applications. MTX provides a set of APIs that let developers create payment solutions using points, promotional rewards, or virtual currency and coupons. MTX provides access to in-app microtransactions on top of a highly capable, hosted environment for application developers to offload the heavy transaction burden.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Many modern user engagement models have a reward transaction associated with almost every action that a user takes. For example, a user can earn points for checking into the application, spending time in the application, participating in a survey, posting comments in the forum, or sharing product information with the friends over social networks. Once earned, points can be expended when the user employs certain features of the application, plays a game, or purchases some in-app digital items or entertaining gadgets. The volume of microtransactions that can be generated by a modern application using this model to keep users engaged can be very large.</p>

<p>Examples of interesting use cases for microtransactions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Attracting users to play games using free points</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Providing an in-application store relevant to users</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rewarding customers with loyalty points for their purchases</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allowing customers to earn points based on their behavior, such as opening an account, sharing products with friends, or writing reviews</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Letting customers redeem points when purchasing products</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attracting customers using coupons that contain points or price discounts</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Promoting product sales with product bundles and sales campaigns</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>MTX enables service providers to tap into one of the fastest growing monetization models in the online and mobile industries: the in-app microtransaction. The use of app-based virtual coins, points, and tokens that can be used to fulfill microtransactions is growing rapidly, thanks to the proliferation of mobile and social network games and applications.</p>

<p>With MTX, Service Providers Can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Focus on content by offloading the high-volume micropayment processing to the MTX platform</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use microtransactions as another source of revenue, different from traditional advertising and paid content models, by providing users the ability to pay with virtual currency</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Engage, convert, and retain users with contextual product offerings, coupons, and sales campaigns</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="real-time-payments">Real-Time Payments</h2>

<p><a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/research-categories/real-time-payments-experiences-adoption">Real-time payments</a> enrich the payment ecosystem – not only do they provide alternative means of payment, but they also provide ample opportunities to develop new consumer and business services. Real-time payments (RTP) provide consumers and businesses with the ability to immediately send and receive funds directly from their accounts at financial institutions anytime 24/7/365. RTP represents a new phase of evolution within the payments industry, with several key features – specifically speed, dependability, and immediate availability of transaction status. RTP will provide FIs with the functionality and features to innovate for the future. Many countries are developing “faster payments” systems to expedite the movement of money and increase the speed that transferred funds are made available to recipients.</p>

<p>What Are Real-Time Payments (RTP)?</p>

<p><a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/research-categories/real-time-payments-experiences-adoption">Real-time payments</a> provide consumers and businesses with the ability to conveniently send and receive immediate fund transfers directly from their accounts at FIs, anytime 24/7/365. Financial institutions can leverage a variety of features – enhanced speed, security, and messaging capabilities – to create unique offerings for their retail and corporate customers. RTP also provides a backbone on which new business models can be redefined.</p>

<p>Characteristics of RTP</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>24/7/365: The RTP system will operate on a 24/7/365 model, which means the system will be available for customers to send or receive payments at any time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediate Availability: Recipients will receive the payment within seconds of the Sender initiating the transaction; the FI is required to make funds available immediately, except where necessary for risk management or legal compliance purposes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Payment Certainty: Senders will not be able to revoke or recall a payment once it has been authorized and submitted to the RTP system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ubiquity: The RTP system will be accessible by all financial institutions, regardless of size or charter type, and will reach the vast majority of US account holders.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extensibility: Rich, flexible messaging functionality will be included to support value-added products.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>RTP Use Cases</p>

<p>Business-to-Business (B2B) Payments</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A small business paying an invoice in order to get a deep discount by the buyer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A restaurant making payments to a supplier after finding a good deal.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Business-to-Consumer (B2C) Payments</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A retail bank distributing personal loan proceeds to a dealership on behalf of a customer who is at the showroom buying a new car.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An insurance company adjuster reviewing a claim, determining a settlement amount, and immediately providing funds to the policyholder who’s at the hospital waiting for the surgery.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Person-to-Person (<a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/31-p2p-insurance-startups/">P2P</a>)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Friends splitting monthly rent and utility payments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A father sending emergency funds to his daughter to pay the school fees.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The RTP Ecosystem</p>

<p>There are primarily three players in the RTP Ecosystem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Financial Institutions: Financial Institutions of all sizes will have the ability to directly connect to the RTP core infrastructure to provide real-time payments capability and value-added services to their customers and clients. FIs may also connect through third-party service providers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearing Houses: The Clearing House hosts the RTP core infrastructure for the US that provides:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Payment processing and settlement services: The RTP system will clear and settle payments and transmit value-added, payment-related messages to and from FIs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anti-fraud: The RTP system will centrally monitor for network-level fraudulent activity and provide fraud alerts to FIs. This capability will augment and support the FIs own automated real-time fraud detection capabilities with respect to transactions they send to and receive from the RTP system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Third-Party Service Providers: Third-party service providers will provide connectivity to RTP providing access to FIs that may not want to connect directly to the RTP system. They will also integrate RTP into their existing and new payments products for the benefit of these FIs’ account holders.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Drivers for RTP</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Customer Demand: In today’s world of sophisticated computing devices, information is moving in real-time. With high-speed data networks, customers expect everything – including payments – to keep up with their pace of life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Convenience: Customers are moving away from cash and checks in favor of the convenience associated with newer banking channels, like online and mobile. Growth rates of non-cash transactions in mature markets (North America, Europe, mature Asia-Pacific) have accelerated in the past few years, accounting for almost three-quarters of the payments market.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increased Transparency: A faster pace of life means making sure payment information is transparent and readily available. Customers are looking for robust, real-time payment information, including payment status and immediate confirmation of funds availability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Greater Value: Banks and non-bank payment service providers are creating value-added services such as automated matching of purchase orders to invoices for businesses or geolocation-based in-store promotions for consumers. These value-added services can span the entire purchasing experience beyond the payment itself. They enrich the basic payment data with a wider set of information to create added value. The RTP system addresses consumer demands in the digital age – providing a way for consumers to make immediate payments to merchants and vendors in a safe and convenient manner.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>RTP Adoption Obstacles</p>

<p>What Stands in the Way of Creating a Real-Time Payments System?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>One-off investment costs and ongoing costs: Real-time projects require relatively high levels of investment. One-off costs cover the development (or modification) of the central RTP system; the banks’ internal IT infrastructures; and the banks’ core operations processes. Ongoing costs cover the investment needed for the daily operations, annual maintenance and support of these systems. The changes can be sizable. Historically, retail bank processing has been dominated by the overnight batch, while a real-time service, demands continuous processing, with 24/7 uptime, without interruption. This has a knock-on effect on the associated operational and risk management processes, which must manage higher transaction volumes with richer and more complex data, whilst ensuring adequate AML and fraud detection, and customer support.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of a fragmented landscape: If multiple RTP solutions, with different operational and network requirements, co-exist in a given currency market or region, then banks may need to join several RTP systems to respond to their customers’ needs. This requirement to comply with a fragmented landscape will result in additional expense unless true business, legal and technical system interoperability has been achieved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Uncertain revenue potential: In most cases, retail consumers do not expect to be charged a premium for real-time payments. Business-to-business transactions typically can be monetized, but this may inhibit wide adoption. The Federal Reserve Bank estimated implementation costs would be in the range of USD 0.9 to 1.8 billion and that per-transaction costs would reduce from USD 0.47 to USD 0.27. The net result is that the overall business case would be neutral or negative.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of the reasons cited can be attributed to the inability to visualize the benefits coming from RTP, and the fear of losing existing revenue from delayed payments.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Global Adoption of RTP</p>

<p>As of September 2016, there were 18 countries ‘live’ with RTP systems – 12 countries that are ‘exploring/planning/building,’ and an additional block of 17 countries that are ‘exploring’ through a pan-Eurozone initiative. Several of these countries are considering how best to implement real-time payments but have yet to publish the way forward. At least 12 countries have implemented 24/7 retail RTP systems supporting immediate low-value account-to-account transfers, and work is well underway in Australia, Europe, and the United States.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/retpaym/euro/html/index.en.html">The European Retail Payments Board</a> has agreed on “the need for at least one pan-European instant payment solution. In the United States, the Federal Reserve Board has called for the implementation of “a safe, ubiquitous, faster payments capability and The Clearing House has announced that it will create a national RTP system. The diagram below illustrates the global span of 24/7 retail RTP systems to date. There is a clear trend towards more and more countries either having the ability to conduct faster payment transactions or starting the process of developing a system that allows them to do so.</p>

<h2 id="wholesale-and-corporate-payments">Wholesale and Corporate Payments</h2>

<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/europe-business-to-business-b2b-payments-market-snapshot/">B2B</a> (business-to-business) is the exchange of products, services or information (e-commerce) between businesses, rather than between businesses and consumers.</p>

<p>B2B2C is a business model where online, or e-commerce, businesses and portals reach new markets and customers by partnering with consumer-oriented product and service businesses. A business developing a product, service or solution partners with another business to use a particular service, such as an e-commerce website, portal or blog.</p>

<p>B2B2C model combines business to business (B2B) and business to consumer (B2C) for a complete product or service transaction. B2B2C is a collaborative process that, in theory, creates mutually beneficial service and product delivery channels.</p>

<p>An explanatory example of B2B2C model:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Business A pays Business B for users, leads or sales generated by Business B’s business or website.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Business A then uses Business B’s channels to locate prospective customers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Business B provides its customers with new and relevant services, facilitating an increased customer base and earned revenue for sold products and services.</p>

<h2 id="api-banking">API Banking</h2>

<p>What are APIs?</p>

<p>Originally developed 15 to 20 years ago in the era of enterprise systems and service-oriented architecture (SOA), Application Programming Interfaces (<a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/apis-obliterating-technology-challenges/">APIs</a>) are software tools that enable different systems and applications to talk to each other and share processing and data. In their early days, APIs were largely internally-focused, proprietary and non-standardized, meaning they were inaccessible to the outside world and that substantial customization work was needed to link to them. But today, with the emergence of open APIs, their role and importance have escalated to a whole new level.</p>

<p>The concept of <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/how-open-apis-are-reshaping-the-future-of-payments/">open API</a></p>

<p>Historically, banks competed against each other on the strength of their own services and technology portals – which, until recently, were almost invariably developed, owned and managed internally. Now, however, they’re moving to a world where the basis of differentiation has shifted to two other criteria: first, their core transaction banking services and fees – essentially the transactional “engine” into which third-parties can integrate their customer-focused front-ends; and secondly the quality of the open APIs they offer to enable third-parties to achieve this integration. In this context, the “quality” of the APIs comes down to the accuracy, timeliness and comprehensiveness of the information they can share. Open APIs are visible externally, easier and simpler to access. Their emergence over the past decade or so reflects the rise of the developer as a force in corporate IT. Open APIs emerged to enable new software to be developed on top of other products and platforms. To meet these needs, open APIs share a number of characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Developer-friendly and developer-centric,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accessible from outside the corporate firewall,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Built using web-based programming,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Fine-grained” and standardized, enabling developers to take advantage of multiple APIs from multiple vendors and attach new utility to existing systems quickly and easily.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These qualities have seen open APIs take off rapidly in industries such as technology and social media. Now, these same attributes are positioning them as a disruptive and potentially revolutionary force in banking and payments.</p>

<p>The Benefits of Open APIs</p>

<p>The development and implementation of an open API standard for banking will permit authorized intermediaries to access information about bank services, prices and service quality and customer usage. This will enable new services to be delivered that are tailored to customers’ specific needs.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/pay-12.png" alt="pay-12.png" /></p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-magic-of-open-apis/">The Magic of Open APIs</a></p>

<p>The benefits of open APIs are positioning them as a disruptive and potentially revolutionary force in banking and payments. Traditionally, banks have built, owned and controlled the channels and applications through which customers access their services – be a retail customer checking their balance online or undertaking a mobile transfer, or a corporation initiating a batch of cross-border payments. With open APIs, third-party developers can gain access to banks’ systems and build their own channels and interactive screens for customers to use. The result is that customers are able to see and manage their banking transactions and accounts through portals that the banks haven’t set up and can’t directly control.</p>

<p>A variety of <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/top-banking-apis-enabling-access-to-aggregated-rich-financial-data/">banking APIs providers</a> have expanded opportunities for entrepreneurs to build solutions for different segments of the financial services industry:</p>

<ul>

  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-most-important-thing-in-fintech-advent-of-apis-and-banking-apis-are-real-too/">Banking APIs</a> are known to enable banking customers – through a single application – to manage accounts held with several providers. They also allow customers to authorize the movement of funds between current and deposit accounts to help avoid overdraft charges or to benefit from higher interest payments. They let customers make simple, safe and reliable price and service quality comparisons tailored to their own usage patterns.</p>

<p>For businesses/institutions, banking APIs allow to monitor a current account and forecast a customer’s cash flow. Using businesses’ transaction history, API providers allow a potential lender to reliably assess business’s creditworthiness and offer better lending deals than they would without this information.</p>

<p>Main Adoption Drivers</p>

<p>For both banks and the third-parties tapping into their systems, open APIs is a seismic shift that’s being driven by a number of forces. A specific driver in Europe – and one that may have wide implications globally, depending on how the rules are interpreted – is the European Union’s second Payments Services Directive (PSD2), which mandates that banks must open up access to accounts, payment flows and end-customer data to third-parties approved by those customers. But even without such regulations, the global move towards open APIs in banking is unstoppable for two main reasons:</p>

<p>Rapid Worldwide Emergence of the FinTech Industry</p>

<p>The first is the rapid worldwide emergence of the FinTech industry, delivering a constant stream of innovation focused on meeting customers’ financial services needs more effectively – especially in areas like payments, mortgages, and financial management for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). All bank customers – including major corporations – are now demanding payments, cash management and treasury service experiences that mirror the speed, ease and convenience provided by consumer applications and devices. They don’t mind whether these solutions are provided by their bank or a non-bank third-party – and the rise of FinTech means the latter is increasingly the case.</p>

<p>Banks are eager to harness this innovation quickly and flexibly within their own offerings to win and retain customers. To help them do this, they’re moving away from purpose-built solutions to an environment where they assemble solutions from a series of vendors, using open APIs as the “glue” to link all the components together and create the customer experience they’re seeking to deliver. This approach generally involves using software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, where applications can be provisioned easily at a low upfront cost, and then dialed up and down as needed.</p>

<p>Growing Need for Real-Time Service Experiences and Information</p>

<p>The second key driver for adoption of open APIs is the growing need for real-time service experiences and information, including the ongoing implementation of real-time or “immediate” payments infrastructures across the world. This trend means the traditional model of creating batch files of transactions and sharing them via an FTP site is no longer fit for purpose, with organizations and applications needing to exchange data in real time – a requirement ideally suited to the use of publicly-available APIs. Among banks, a leader in this area is BBVA, which has effectively published its entire banking platform on the Internet for other organizations to innovate around. This move reflects the wider pivot in the software industry from products to platforms, enabling problems to be solved faster, more efficiently and more holistically.</p>

<p>Implementation Options</p>

<ul>
  <li>On-Premise Deployment</li>
</ul>

<p>With on-premise deployment, banks integrate their preferred API technology into the payment services hub. This model should ideally allow for real-time payment initiation and inquiry all the way from the point of demand by the end-user in the third-party application to the execution in the payment hub. Banks should also look for a solution that offers an extended suite of highly granular services for everything from debit authorization to fee calculation to payment submission.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hosted Applications</li>
</ul>

<p>With this approach, the bank utilizes a hosted service that houses all the software and hardware required to run its payments operation, under either a multi-tenant service bureau or dedicated managed service model. In an open API world, the solution should enable third parties – payment initiation service providers (PISPs) and account information service providers (AISPs), in the language of the EU’s PSD2 – to connect directly to secure, controlled APIs housed within the infrastructure. Ideally, the chosen solution should combine the benefits of pay-per-use provisioning of best-in-class technology for payments processing and execution, with one-stop access to the world of open APIs.</p>

<p>With Either Approach – Security Is Critical to Successful Implementation</p>

<p>Organizations across all industries are moving from a world where security was defined in terms of “guarding” to one where effective security can only be accomplished through “sharing.” The best example of this shift is the disruptive power of blockchain technology, where strong security can be achieved through a capability that’s both open and public. So while opening up systems through APIs does present risks, these can be overcome through the right technologies and collaborative approaches.</p>

<p>The Requirements</p>

<p>The oversight of payment instruments should be aimed at ensuring the soundness and efficiency of payments made with such instruments. The soundness of payment instruments may be exposed to various risks, as is any payment system. Therefore, all schemes offering payment instruments covered by the scope of the oversight activity should comply with the following standards:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme should have a sound legal basis under all relevant jurisdictions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme should ensure that comprehensive information, including appropriate information on financial risks, is available for all actors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme should ensure an adequate degree of security, operational reliability, and business continuity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme should implement effective, accountable and transparent governance arrangements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme should manage and contain financial risks in relation to the clearing and settlement process</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="harmonization-of-payments-standards">Harmonization of Payments Standards</h2>

<p>What Is ISO 20022?</p>

<p>ISO 20022: Universal financial industry message scheme – is the international standard that defines the ISO platform for the development of financial message standards. ISO 20022 is seen as a way to improve payments efficiency, to create a common, level playing field.</p>

<p>The first focus of ISO 20022 is on international (cross-border) financial communication between financial institutions, their clients and the domestic or international ‘market infrastructures’ involved in the processing of financial transactions. There is, however, a strong opportunity to use ISO 20022 for the development of new domestic financial messages as well, thereby streamlining all communications for financial institutions.</p>

<p>The Necessity for ISO 20022</p>

<p>The need for an ISO 20022 standard arose in the early 2000s with the widespread growth of Internet Protocol (IP) networking, the emergence of XML as the ‘de facto’ open technical standard for electronic communications and the appearance of a multitude of uncoordinated XML-based standardization initiatives, each having used their own “XML dialect.” The ISO 20022 standard offered a common way of using XML and a way to shield investments from future syntax changes by proposing a common business modeling methodology to capture, analyze and syntax-independently describe the business processes of potential users and their information needs.</p>

<p>The ISO 20022 flexible framework will encourage users to build business transactions and message models under an internationally agreed upon approach, and to migrate to the use of a common vocabulary and a common set of syntaxes. In ISO 20022, the models and the derived XML or ASN.1 (a data specification and encoding technology jointly standardized by ISO, IEC, and ITU, and widely used across several industries, such as cellular telephony, signaling, network management, directory, public key infrastructure, video conferencing, aeronautics, intelligent transportation, etc.) outputs are stored in a central financial repository serviced by a registration authority. The ISO 20022 repository offers industry users and developers free access to a Data Dictionary of business and message components and a Business Process Catalogue containing message models and corresponding XML and/or ASN.1 schemas.</p>

<p>If there are no ISO 20022 messages to cover a specific transaction, standards initiatives can be launched to define new models and messages and submit the new solution for approval by the ISO 20022 registration bodies. If the messages exist in the ISO 20022 repository but do not address all requirements of a new community, it can be agreed upon to update the existing models and messages and create a new version that will accommodate the needs of all.</p>

<p>“By taking a standardized global approach to ISO 20022 implementation, the industry as a whole will be in a much better place to manage and lower costs, ensure efficient implementation, and most importantly, keep the focus where it should be – serving our customers.” - MARCUS SEHR, Global Head – Institutional Cash, Deutsche Bank</p>

<p>The ISO 20022 message dashboard gives an overall picture of the five financial business domains in the scope of ISO 20022. Its purpose is to show which business processes are already supported either by existing ISO 20022 message definitions or by candidate message definitions covered by an approved business justification.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Payments: Messages supporting cash account management, payments initiation, clearing and settlement, and cash management, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Securities: Messages supporting pre-trade, trade, post-trade, clearing and settlement, securities management, securities account management, reconciliation, asset servicing, collateral management, etc.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Distributed Ledger Technology</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/10-blockchain-companies-applying-distributed-ledger-technology-to-compliance/">Distributed Ledger Technology</a> (DLT), or blockchain technology, will have a beneficial impact on each of the four parts comprising the global payments structure: relationship investment, funds transfer, funds delivery, and proof of payment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cryptocurrency</li>
</ul>

<p>A cryptocurrency-based global payment solution would thus work very differently from credit cards and other online transfers. Instead of the payment being authorized by the owner and then taken from the account by the recipient, the owner transfers the coins directly to the recipient – a “push” model, rather than an “authorize and pull” model. Cryptocurrency-based global payment solutions offer the possibility of vastly improving the speed and security of international payments while reducing transaction costs. However, as cryptocurrencies become more attractive as international payment solutions, businesses may need to fundamentally rethink the way they manage their cash flow.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Internet of Things (IoT)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/iot-in-banking-exploring-exciting-opportunities/">Internet of Things (IoT) is changing payments</a>; that is, in the IoT, payments “disappear” behind devices or become invisible. There are a few technologies that are highly relevant to financial institutions that need to happen to make the payments piece of the puzzle come together: tokenization, embedded commerce, and APIs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Tokenization: Tokenization allows the credit card number be replaced with a limited use token to be used for authorization for payments. Limited use token can only be used by a specific device for a specific task to secure the execution and private information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Embedded commerce: Devices require embedded applications to enable payments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>APIs: Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are required to communicate the request from the device for a service, and, more importantly, to receive the payment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Online <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/payment-fraud-challenge/">payments fraud</a> is the space for a machine learning technique that uses historical and live data to create patterns for customers’ behavior. These patterns allow the system to make accurate fraud predictions. Machine learning is now used to prevent, or at least limit, fraud attempts.</p>

<h2 id="how-blockchain-will-change-global-payments-1">How Blockchain Will Change Global Payments</h2>

<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/22-bitcoin-companies-allowing-merchants-to-accept-payments-in-cryptocurrency/">Cryptocurrency payments</a> work in much the same way as cash. The owner keeps their coins in a secure digital wallet to which only he/she has the “key” – a digital signature that only the owner knows. The wallet can receive payments without being opened, but to make a payment the owner must open the wallet with the key.</p>

<p>To make things extra safe, some wallets have multiple keys: for example, a wallet might have three digital signatures, one held by the owner, a second held by a trusted third party and a third in offline (“cold”) storage. Making a B2B payment from one of these “multisig” wallets requires two or more keys, not just one. This is not unlike business checks that must be countersigned to be valid for payment.</p>

<p>A cryptocurrency-based global payment solution would thus work very differently from credit cards and other online transfers. Instead of the payment being authorized by the owner and then taken from the account by the recipient, the owner transfers the coins directly to the recipient – a “push” model, rather than an “authorize and pull” model. To make the payment, of course, the owner must have enough coins in the wallet.</p>

<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/crypto-wallet-for-cryptocurrency-adoption-and-regulation/">Cryptocurrency</a> payments typically clear much faster than today’s international B2B payments, since there are no intermediaries.** And as the wallet must contain enough coins for the payment to be made at all, in theory, the payment cannot fail.</p>

<p>Broadly, there are two types of verification protocols employed by cryptocurrencies vying to be the next big global payments solution:</p>

<p>Bitcoin’s “proof of work” is a highly innovative solution to the verification problem, and it remains the most popular protocol. It involves solving cryptographic puzzles. When a puzzle is solved, a new “block” of transactions is confirmed and the user, or “miner,” is rewarded with new coins and transactions fees. As more coins are created, the puzzles become progressively more difficult, requiring larger and larger amounts of computing power. However, proof-of-work verification is relatively slow (at least 10 minutes), and its energy-intensive nature encourages the formation of “mining pools” or miner “oligarchs” which can monopolize verification. Effectively, this creates central intermediaries that may be corrupt or become a target for malicious attacks.</p>

<p>Because of this, some cryptocurrencies are adopting <strong>“proof-of-stake,”</strong> where the ability to verify transaction blocks is determined by the size of the miner’s investment. Proof-of-stake is less vulnerable to monopolization and malicious attacks, but on its own, it encourages fragmentation of the system, so it is usually combined with some other mechanism to discourage excessive mining. Nextcoin, for example, randomly selects the verifier for a new block using a lottery-type mechanism. Clearly, the more coins a user holds, the more likely they are to be selected as the verifier.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/pay-15.png" alt="pay-15.png" /></p>

<p>IoT Payments</p>

<p>The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) offers payments companies an opportunity to expand beyond mobile phones, cards, and point-of-sale devices, to a broad and diverse ecosystem of internet-connected devices. Some estimates suggest that there will be 24 billion connected devices installed globally by 2020, up from nearly 7 billion today. And &gt;5 billion will be consumer connected devices by 2020, representing a massive expansion of touch points that could eventually offer payments functionality.</p>

<p>IoT is changing payments, that is, in the IoT, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/in-the-world-of-invisible-payments/">payments “disappear” behind devices or become invisible</a>. Payments are becoming a component of every connected device and object on the market – ranging from the Amazon Echo to fitness trackers and smartwatches, to automobiles. As this occurs, increased emphasis is being placed on the overall commerce experience, with a noted drive toward frictionless and seamless transactions. Recent innovations such as tokenization have buoyed the industry’s drive toward connected commerce, helping support the payments status quo for some value-chain participants, while disintermediation threatens others. With the framework for the <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/iot-in-banking-exploring-exciting-opportunities/">‘Internet of (payment) Things’</a> now falling into place, the next wave of commerce innovation will come increasingly from ‘things buying things’ – building on top of ambient and frictionless payments.</p>

<p>Card networks have developed a basic framework to enable commerce in everyday devices. Visa and Mastercard are creating the underlying infrastructure to support the standardization of payments integration and stake themselves out as the key connected payments gatekeepers. Their payment platforms are universal, allowing digital payments to grow without being tied to the success of a particular manufacturer.</p>

<p>Consumer-facing IoT companies have much to gain from enabling payments in their devices, including improving the value of the device, being able to cross-sell products through the device, and laying the groundwork for future opportunities to earn incremental revenue. For payments companies, connected payments offer a new revenue stream and an opportunity to gain market share ahead of competitors. <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/wearable-technology-will-accelerate-the-adoption-of-biometric-technology/">Wearables</a>, connected cars, and smart home devices are expected to be the top connected payments product categories.</p>

<p>Opportunities</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Distribution: IoT will break the non-secure, inefficient payment-card model by enabling a more advanced distribution network that eliminates the need for physical cards. At the same time, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/iot-powered-transformation-in-the-insurance-industry/">IoT</a> will increase the speed and efficiency of consumers’ purchasing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acceptance: Early IoT deployments show the opportunity for ‘things’ such as automobiles, appliances, and wearables to become platforms for commerce. These deployments underscore the way in which <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/5-risks-that-iot-brought-to-our-lives-and-how-to-avoid-them/">IoT</a> is expanding commerce to a plethora of channels. IoT significantly expands the payment-acceptance network by converting any connected device into an endpoint for commerce. Expansion of the acceptance network will drive the industry’s goal of displacing cash and expanding card volume.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conversion: Eliminating friction in the purchasing process is a critical goal in commerce – the easier it is to purchase goods and services, the higher the likelihood for conversion and repeat business. IoT plays to this goal by expanding the number of environments in which commerce can occur. In a world of connected things, commerce is no longer limited to traditional channels and contexts. IoT allows commerce to happen at the time and place of consumers’ choosing – be it over interactive voice response in cars, an Amazon Dash button on washing machines, or during a commercial on smart TVs. Successful IoT commerce experiences will require simplicity, immediacy, and context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/reimagining-loyalty-programs-with-blockchain-technology/">Loyalty</a>: The IoT world also offers a unique opportunity to drive loyalty with its user base that can be tailored to a specific device category. For example, a wearable device that can identify the type of rewards suitable for its user, such as a free water bottle at a nearby store for every 10 miles run; a connected car that autonomously activates a discount coupon from a gas station nearby based on location and brand loyalty; a smart meter that automatically detects usage and provides discounts to homeowners for optimal use of heating during the winter.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>AI/ML in Payments</p>

<p>Accelerated innovations in the online payments industry perpetuate sophistication of methods to steal sensitive data. Fraudsters are constantly changing their tactics to make their efforts more effective. And for online businesses, it’s getting harder to determine which transaction looks good and which one should be rejected. Well-known fraud management systems based on rules require more manual reviews so the entire purchasing process could take longer. Today, while e-commerce and m-commerce are is constantly growing, retailers have less time to detect fraudsters manually. Moreover, fraudsters are getting cleverer and they are utilizing new technology to launch more complex attacks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the cost of fraud continues to rise. At the beginning of 2015, less than $2 out of $100 was subjected to a fraud attack, but by Q1 2016, it was $7.3 out of every $100. **Online payments fraud is the space for a machine learning technique that uses historical and live data to create patterns for customers’ behavior. These patterns allow the system to make accurate fraud predictions. Machine learning is now used to prevent, or at least limit, fraud attempts.</p>

<p>Advanced algorithms evaluate every transaction for fraud risk and take appropriate action. The system creates deep profiles based on gathered data and analyzes it to make the most accurate predictions and prevent fraud attempts. Machine learning integrates historical data with streaming information and is able to make the analysis in real-time. When a machine has more data, its accuracy will improve + a machine can check larger amounts of data in a much more efficient manner than humans. With machine-based processes, a person could check just one transaction in about five minutes.</p>

<p>Another major use case of AI in payments is <strong>Smart Wallets</strong> that are able to monitor and learn users’ spending habits and needs, analyze them and based on the results, alert and coach users, when appropriate, to show restraint and to alter their personal finance spending and saving behavior.</p>

Keep an eye out each week for new stories! If you or someone you know should be highlighted, send us a note. Without further ado…</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/1d3affe.png" alt="1d3affe.png" /></p>

<p>Company Name: <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/companies/reliamax">ReliaMax</a> Holding Company</p>

<p>Name/Title: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-vanerdewyk-695712b5/">Mike VanErdewyk</a>, CEO &amp; Founder</p>

<p>Industry Segment: Private student loan solutions provider</p>

<p>Target Market(s): US</p>

<p>LTP: Tell us a little bit about yourself, please.</p>

<p>Mike VanErdewyk: I was born and raised in South Dakota. I attended Dakota State University and earned my degree in Biology. Most of my career has been in financial services at companies like Prudential, EF Hutton, and Merrill Lynch. I’ve also started several companies, with ReliaMax being my most recent. ReliaMax began in 2005 as a Workers’ Compensation insurance company. In July 2006, ReliaMax acquired HEMAR Insurance Corporation from <a href="https://www.salliemae.com/">Sallie Mae</a>, which launched us into the private student loan business, literally overnight.</p>

<p>LTP: Give us a paragraph pitch of your company.</p>

<p>MZV: <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/companies/reliamax">ReliaMax </a>is the “Uber” of private <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/online-lending-for-students-on-the-rise/">student loans</a>; we connect student borrowers who need loans with banks, credit unions and alternative lenders that can provide loans. Similar to how Uber doesn’t own the cars, we don’t own the loans. Rather, we work with over 450 banks and credit unions to connect them with borrowers (students and their co-signers) and we administer, originate, service and insure the loans on a lender’s behalf. That makes it easy, fast and efficient for lenders to enter the private student loan asset class with low risk and attractive, predictable profit.</p>

<p>LTP: In a sentence or two, what problem are you solving today?</p>

<p>MZV: Private student loans are the second-largest asset class after mortgages, yet most lenders are not offering them. We help financial institutions of all sizes enter this asset class and put their capital to work profitably, without assuming much of the risk associated with launching a new product.</p>

<p>On the borrower side, we enable lenders to offer private student loans to a broader range of student borrowers because not everyone has an 800 FICO score. Through private student loans, banks and credit unions can attract and retain their customer/member base of the future—millennials and Gen Z—which is so critical to the continued growth of these lenders.</p>

<p>LTP: Who are you selling to?</p>

<p>MZV: The ReliaMax Solution, which is our private student loan platform-as-a-service, includes borrower acquisition, origination, servicing, insurance and <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/innovation-capital-markets-research-report-by-medici/">capital markets</a> execution for banks, credit unions, and alternative lenders. We also provide Connext, our branded private student loan platform that helps our lenders acquire new borrowers.</p>

<p>Our value-added services for financial institutions include things like program design, comprehensive underwriting, default prevention, marketing and customer acquisition support and portfolio liquidity. If a financial institution wants to buy a student loan portfolio as an investable asset, we can also help them acquire the portfolio and convert the servicing onto our platform. We’ve helped many banks to do this over the last couple of years, including – most recently – <a href="https://www.metabank.com/">MetaBank</a>’s $151-million portfolio.</p>

<p>LTP: Why did you start the company?</p>

<p>MZV: By helping banks help students fund their education, everyone benefits – the student, the bank, the community, and the world. That is a core part of my vision for the company and the values of ReliaMax. Every team member is committed to helping students realize their dreams of education.</p>

<p>In 2009, we began insuring private student loans through our subsidiary, ReliaMax Surety Company. Since then, we’ve insured over $3 billion in private student loans and now have 30 years and $15 billion worth of student loan data. This trove of data and analytics going back three decades is what gives us the unique ability to underwrite loans further down into the credit spectrum and price insurance premiums according to the risk. We’re making real loans for real people—mostly in-school loans—not just refinancing for the super prime market. Our lenders love this; we’re giving them a 4%-6% net yield that is fully insured on the principal and interest. And collectively, we’re bringing them an addressable market that’s much larger than the super prime market that many of the newer entrant online lenders are targeting.</p>

<p>LTP: What’s the most important change coming to your segment in the next 3-5 years?</p>

<p>MZV: The most important change is that more and more students and their families will use private student loans in place of income, retirement savings, credit cards and home equity lines to fund the education gap. Likewise, we see private student loans taking share from federal student loans, as the government looks to reset its balance sheet.</p>

<p>We know the current White House administration is looking for ways to reduce some of the outstanding federal student loan debt, which now stands at $1.29 trillion. The Wall Street Journal reported that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-than-40-of-student-borrowers-arent-making-payments-1459971348">some 40% of federal student loan borrowers</a> are not making repayments. That’s a problem that is unique to federal student loans; private student loan default rates are way below that in the single digits.</p>

<p>One solution would be for the government to sell its loans to private lenders, who can then treat them like an investable asset. Or they might put limits on federal loans that aren’t need-based, like PLUS loans for graduate school or parents, which would position private student loans as an invaluable financing option.</p>

<p>In terms of industry change, private student loans are really an untapped asset class. There’s an addressable market of $172 billion in annual higher education spending that’s not covered by federal aid. Currently, only $10 billion of higher education costs are funded with private student loans, and further opportunity exists in student loan consolidations and refinancing.</p>

<p>As more financial institutions see how easy – low risk and profitable – it is to enter this asset class, we’ll see a stronger demand for origination, servicing, and insurance. More competition in the marketplace will lower the cost of borrowing capital and increase the terms and choices available to students. To put this another way, with more skin in the game, the incentives will grow for lenders, resulting in even better pricing for students. As it stands right now, we have more lending capacity than we have borrowers. We love being in this position and not being reliant on securitization markets.</p>

<p>LTP: What’s your next milestone?</p>

<p>MZV: ReliaMax just announced that we’re now servicing $275 million in private student loans, an increase of nearly 670% from the close of 2015, We also have our eyes on further expansion across in-school, refinance and specialty private student loan programs such as for international medical degrees and for students from abroad that are pursuing their MBA degrees in the US.</p>

<p>This are exciting times for <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/companies/reliamax">ReliaMax </a>as we are experiencing growth across the board for all our products and in all our markets.</p>

<p>LTP: Anything else you want to say to our audience?</p>

<p>MZV: I’m fond of saying that the private market innovation that can be brought forward to solve this public debt problem is limitless and imaginable. I recently spoke at the <a href="http://www.tearsheet.co/events/tearsheet-money-conference">Tearsheet Money Conference</a> and discussed five basic ways that banks and alternative lenders can become private student lenders. These boil down to fundamental points such as underwriting, servicing, customer experience, innovation and investing in the asset class. If you have additions to the list, I definitely invite you to connect with ReliaMax on <a href="https://twitter.com/reliamax?lang=en">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/434515/">LinkedIn</a> or email us at contact@reliamax.com and bring your ideas forward.</p>

<p>LTP: What’s one thing you wish customers knew before a sales meeting?</p>

<p>MZV: Private student loans and federal student loans are two very different assets. Many people confuse the two and equate federal student loan headline risk to private student loans. We’re always educating the market on the difference. Most importantly, federal student loans have very limited underwriting, whereas private student loans use stricter, credit-based underwriting—we look at a borrower’s ability to repay the loan over time. This is why private student loan default rates remain low, and why they’re an attractive asset class for banks and credit unions.</p>

<p>LTP: If you could change one thing that financial services people do incorrectly, what would that be?</p>

<p>MZV: It’s more of a perception, but I’d like financial institutions to recognize that they have incredibly sustainable businesses and that some “disruptor” lenders, despite all their bells and whistles, aren’t necessarily what their customers need or want – nor necessarily will their customers be a target because some of these lenders tend to skim the super prime credit, high-earner market. That leaves many qualified borrowers with fewer options.</p>

<p>Financial institutions, particularly community banks and <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/creditunions/">credit unions</a>, serve a critical role – along with many others – in the higher education ecosystem. They help a student gain affordable financing, whether or not he or she has maxed out on federal aid.</p>

<p>Customers want to know that their bank or credit union has a terrific product they want at the stage of life they’re in; this is what drives lifetime customer value. Customers also like knowing they’ll have a single point of contact over the lifetime of the loan, and options available to them during difficult times – someone with whom they can develop a relationship, talk through their situation and get meaningful advice. Something banks and credit unions should not lose sight of is their role in building the financial wellness aptitudes of their customers. This is very important to the health of our economy and country.</p>

<p>Without belittling the achievements of exceptions like <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/why-facebook-is-a-dark-horse-in-the-financial-services-industry/">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/video/china-wechat-goes-beyond-social-networking/D7E7D0B3-0207-4DD3-8E1B-2977D38D88B9.html">WeChat</a>, Instagram and a few more apps consistently retaining a loyal audience, there are reasons to believe that <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/understand-future-of-financial-services-industry/">apps as a class of products/solutions are inevitably moving into obsolescence</a>.</p>

<p>Today, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/03/u-s-consumers-now-spend-5-hours-per-day-on-mobile-devices/">US consumers spend five hours a day on mobile devices</a>, and 92% of that time is spent in apps. However, out of that 92%, 19% – the biggest portion of time – is spent on Facebook, making this single app a fairly important gateway.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a different <a href="http://marketingland.com/nearly-85-percent-smartphone-app-time-concentrated-top-five-apps-report-191624">study</a> suggests that nearly half (45%) of smartphone users’ app time is spent on their top app and 73% of their time is spent on the top three apps. Where does it leave all the other apps? It turns out, not in an envious position since a very limited number of apps ensure that one can perform any imaginable and unimaginable task – order a pizza, a cab, pay a friend, contact a brand’s customer service, check your bank balance, and more.</p>

<p>If the general numbers don’t seem convincing, let’s look at a particular vertical – financial apps. A <a href="http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/184034/no-one-winning-battle-digital-wallet-customers.aspx">2015 Gallup study</a> found that only 13% of adults in the US had digital wallets on their smartphones. Moreover, 76% of those who had a digital wallet have never used it or have almost never used it to make a purchase from a retailer in the past 30 days. As a result of an <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/companies?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;page=1&amp;term=&amp;q%5Brocket_eq%5D=0&amp;q%5Btype_eq%5D=&amp;term=&amp;q%5Bname_cont%5D=&amp;q%5Bkeywords%5D=&amp;q%5Bcountry_eq%5D=&amp;q%5Bfounding_year_operator%5D=%3D&amp;q%5Btotal_funding_amount_value_gt%5D=&amp;q%5Btotal_funding_amount_value_lt%5D=&amp;q%5Bdate_of_last_funding_year_eq%5D=&amp;q%5Btags%5D%5B%5D=Mobile\+Wallets%2FPayments">oversaturated payments apps market</a>, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/mobile-wallets-when-too-many-pays-wont-let-anyone-win/">disjoint experiences and disconnected islands of mobile payments solutions now serve as an obstacle to the whole segment to develop</a>.</p>

<p>Image: <a href="https://www.adjust.com/resources/mobile-benchmarks-q3-2016/?utm_channel=1&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_term=app%20retention%20rates%20ph&amp;utm_campaign=Mobile%20Benchmarks%20Q3%2016%20US&amp;gclid=CP7tw5Tjh9QCFU1ufgodG20Jqw">Mobile Benchmarks, Q3 2016</a>; World average; Time Spent is measured in seconds</p>

<p>Moreover, as social apps enrich their functionality over time to become <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/contextual-commerce-from-single-purpose-apps-to-all-in-one-platforms/">universal, all-in-one platforms</a>, financial apps other than mobile banking apps, will inevitably lose their relevance. Increased convenience, speed, and security of transactions offered by those apps will certainly contribute to <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/p2p-payments-migration-from-apps-to-media-channels/">the demise of single-purpose apps</a> that are tailored to just one function.</p>

<p>Facebook is a perfect example – the company has been on a path to double down on a magic number of 1 billion users, where it would start <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/why-facebook-is-a-dark-horse-in-the-financial-services-industry/">the monetization game</a>, and now, as the platform reaches close to 2 billion monthly active users, Mark Zuckerberg is aggressively moving from products to technologies for broad use cases, declaring the obsolescence not only for apps but for conventional physical interfaces (even the smartphone).</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/0222-fa497c.png" alt="0222-fa497c.png" /></p>

<p>India’s UPI (a futuristic solution for the rest of the world) is <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/unified-payments-interface/">a unique case</a> among financial apps other than mobile banking apps, that proves further granulation of the market of single-purpose apps (payments apps, in particular) being futile.</p>

<h2 id="engagement-is-the-philosophers-stone">Engagement is the philosopher’s stone</h2>

<p>While apps in general and B2B+finance apps don’t have the retention data in their corner, there is something important they can learn from successful social apps. After all, <a href="https://www.adjust.com/resources/mobile-benchmarks-q3-2016/?utm_channel=1&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_term=app%20retention%20rates%20ph&amp;utm_campaign=Mobile%20Benchmarks%20Q3%2016%20US&amp;gclid=CP7tw5Tjh9QCFU1ufgodG20Jqw">per session, business apps in the US, for example, perform poorly versus global rates</a> on both iOS and Android devices and, significantly, it’s the only vertical to do so.</p>

<p>It appears that Facebook and the likes have a favorable position partially due to the sequence and the strategy of development. Focus on building the ecosystem first allowed the hottest social apps to get their foot in the door of other worlds, including the financial one. The hottest apps have an upper hand over single-focused newcomers because they have been building their small, but strong, words for years, retaining a loyal audience through social engagement.</p>

<p>In 2017, we are witnessing a perfect storm – hundreds of FinTech startups are launching apps following a perceived hot business opportunity, while social apps reached the level of maturity, wealth, and development to step up their game and get on financial turf.</p>

<p>In spite of all this, engagement is the key to a successful adoption and retention. In fact, studies suggest that <a href="https://www.appboy.com/blog/be-your-customers-ritual-consistent-engagement-results-in-90-audience-retention-after-one-month/">90% of the people who engage weekly for the first month after download are retained</a>, compared to only 23% of people who don’t engage in the second, third and fourth week.</p>

<p>Moreover, 82% of customers who engage in week two are retained, but customers who don’t engage in week two have to engage in both week three and four to reach almost the same level of retention.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>While businesses are catching up with the <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-digital-payments-industry-in-north-america-will-bring-half-a-trillion-in-e-commerce-retail-sales-by-2018/">rise of e-commerce</a> and the <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/we-live-in-a-mobile-first-world/">mobile-first world</a>, physical interfaces altogether are gradually falling into obsolescence. The year 2017 gives strong reasons to believe that working on the enhancement of the experience with any physical interface could be a wasteful attempt to better feed a horse instead of investing in a car (if we were to use Ford’s terms).</p>

<p>The problem is, however, not only in the situation where <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/in-an-age-where-50-of-purchases-are-made-online-74-of-small-businesses-still-dont-have-e-commerce/">businesses are still catching up with basic trends</a>, not speaking of exploring the vast opportunities <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/regtech-companies-in-us-driving-down-compliance-costs-innovation/">RegTech</a> opens, or <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/making-a-difference-fintech-three-examples/">all-in-one business banking solutions</a>. The community of business, FinTech, banking consultants/professionals, in addition, tends to heavily rely on false indicators in an attempt to remain relevant and make predictions. FinTech, often, is one of those wrong indicators, and I will further try to expand on why.</p>

<h2 id="fintech-trends-do-not-predict-the-future-they-often-only-represent-an-immediate-business-opportunity-that-spun-out-of-control-and-beyond-reason">FinTech trends do not predict the future, they often only represent an immediate business opportunity that spun out of control and beyond reason</h2>

<p>There is a massive community of <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/">7.2K+ FinTech startups around the world</a>, bringing undeniable benefits across segments – <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-role-of-mobile-money-in-democratizing-international-remittances-and-driving-financial-inclusion/">democratization of remittances resulted in better inclusion</a>, cross-border payments solutions that <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/electronic-payments-and-financial-inclusion-for-businesses/">shed barriers for businesses</a>, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/how-the-first-ever-blockchain-platform-aims-to-connect-the-worlds-poor-to-the-global-economy/">inclusion through economic identity on the blockchain</a>, and a lot more.</p>

<p>On the other hand, every entrepreneur is a businessman/woman, and every startup is a business venture, pursuing an adequate goal to gain traction, and eventually to profit. While assessing the business opportunity, among other things, entrepreneurs exercise their predictive abilities by estimating market size, potential demand, and industry trends in various segments, as well as look at role models that are successfully working in the segment of interest.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-deal-with-1k-payments-companies-around-the-world">What’s the deal with 1K+ payments companies around the world?</h3>

<p>Let’s look at what happened in payments. Stripe, Square Cash, PayPal, M-Pesa, AliPay, and Venmo are among those role models that opened the floodgates for <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/companies?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;page=1&amp;term=&amp;q%5Brocket_eq%5D=0&amp;q%5Btype_eq%5D=&amp;term=&amp;q%5Bname_cont%5D=&amp;q%5Bkeywords%5D=&amp;q%5Bcountry_eq%5D=&amp;q%5Bfounding_year_operator%5D=%3D&amp;q%5Btotal_funding_amount_value_gt%5D=&amp;q%5Btotal_funding_amount_value_lt%5D=&amp;q%5Bdate_of_last_funding_year_eq%5D=&amp;q%5Btags%5D%5B%5D=Payments">1K+ payments startups around the world</a>. And why not use the opportunity? After all, in <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/10/20/venmo-20-billion/">Q3 2016, PayPal processed nearly $26 billion in mobile payments</a>, up 56% from last year, and representing 29% of PayPal’s total payments volume for the quarter. Looking forward, the company’s CEO Schulman predicted that PayPal would generate $100 billion in mobile payment volume within next 12 months.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/global-fintech-funding-36-bn-2016/">payments and lending/funding have steadily been the most represented and well-funded segments</a>. Within the payments segment, mobile wallets/payments represent the largest piece of the pie, according to <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/companies">MEDICI data</a> – about 34% of companies.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Screen-Shot-2017-06-06-at-11.03.09-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2017-06-06-at-11.03.09-AM.png" /></p>

<p>Data source: <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/companies">MEDICI</a></p>

<p>Coupled with a very clear trend across industries that <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/we-live-in-a-mobile-first-world/">we live in a mobile-first world</a>, the opportunity with mobile payments seems obviously lucrative. Despite the long-worn-off “wow” effect of mobile payments, we see mobile payments startups being launched right and left, without regard to logical questions – do consumers really need another payment app on their phone? Is the experience with every new mobile payment option radically, 10X different than any other payment solution out there? Is this a Blue Ocean situation at all? The answer will most likely (or even definitely) be “NO.”</p>

<p>Speaking of the consumer, in 2015, <a href="http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/184034/no-one-winning-battle-digital-wallet-customers.aspx">Gallup’s research</a> indicated that only 13% of adults in the US had digital wallets on their smartphones. Moreover, 76% of those who had a digital wallet have never used it or have almost never used it to make a purchase from a retailer in the past 30 days. <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/mobile-wallets-when-too-many-pays-wont-let-anyone-win/">Disjoint experiences and disconnected islands of mobile payments solutions now serve as an obstacle to the whole segment to develop</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/211111.png" alt="211111.png" />\
Moreover, apps overall are having trouble with retention – estimates suggest that <a href="https://www.appboy.com/blog/app-customer-retention-spring-2016-report/?utm_source=contentdownload&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=springretentionreport2016&amp;mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWlRGaVpEQmlaRGM0TWpBMiIsInQiOiJwOUk3cU5IRkM4S2h3b1A1enFtcm00TnNCRDYreE0xZmRcL09BNWJvNlwvRkJaQjMrUTJuUmlkMmF6WXgrenRkN3pCTjBDcEtJK2tOT1ZTOWpXK1RyVk9kTDhYcFQ3ajBzQm1ieE9ZU3BvTkhwdlNsSFF3d01nSkRhMjJnK1hNNFIwIn0%3D">&lt;25% of people return to an app the day after initial install</a>, and overall app retention drops to around 11% within a week of install. After 45 days, that number is less than 5%, before hitting 4.1% after 90 days.</p>

<p>I won’t even go into <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/doubts-about-the-business-models-of-fintech-startups-are-growing/">long-time-back questioned business models of FinTech startups</a> and the <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/is-lending-club-an-isolated-case-or-a-sign-of-a-much-bigger-problem/">lending segment</a>, in particular. I also won’t be touching slowly-but-steadily-evolving banking apps that almost caught up with mobile payments app in convenience, and now also have a strong footing in the market aside from basic credit/debit account view functionality. Unique markets like India are ahead of the world; the technologies and business models utilized deserve special attention, but that is, as I mentioned, unique.</p>

<h3 id="the-undeniable-silver-lining">The undeniable silver lining</h3>

<p>Admittedly, we cannot downplay significant achievements that were prompted by the FinTech community. Just to mention a few:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Redefinition of <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-right-ux-makes-all-the-difference-in-banking/">the role of UX/UI in the financial services industry</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>

    <p>Etc.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="follow-cross-industry-leaders-to-understand-where-the-world-is-really-moving-including-the-financial-services-industry">Follow cross-industry leaders to understand where the world is really moving (including the financial services industry)</h2>

<p>As pointed earlier, looking solely at the FinTech stage to understand what’s happening is like <a href="http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/133-physics/general-physics/general-questions/835-why-is-looking-out-into-space-the-same-as-looking-back-in-time-beginner">looking into space</a> – the light that is hitting us now will have started from the object quite a long time ago, so in effect we aren’t looking at what the object looks like now but what it looked like some time ago. The same way, modern saturation of the payments market indicates the success the pioneers that started out a decade ago had/have. It does not mean, however, that mobile payments represent the hottest opportunity right now.</p>

<p>So, how do we make a better case in understanding the direction of development in the financial services industry, whether it’s about institutional banking or FinTech startups? Well, an option could be to look at the advancements that are happening in the areas bootstrapping financial services – IT, computing power advancements, etc. In other words, how does the underlying technology (hardware and software) change, and who facilitates and owns that change?</p>

<h3 id="gradual-obsolescence-of-physical-interfaces-in-favor-of-voice-and-vr">Gradual obsolescence of physical interfaces in favor of voice and VR</h3>

<p>There are a few developments that have been assertively moving interactions between businesses and consumers beyond screens, and physical interfaces overall. More importantly, those developments are not coming from the financial world (whether institutional or the startup community). Let’s look at a few examples of non-financial companies that are advancing alternative interactive interfaces:</p>

<p>1. Apple</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/multiplex/new-apple-patent-siri-jim-the-plumber-is-at-your-front-door-what-should-i-do-36fabc34c0ac">Apple and its fascinating patent for a voice-first home hub and more</a>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianroemmele">Brian Roemmele</a>, <a href="http://www.payfinders.com/">Pay Finders</a>, digs into this curious patent and how Siri will evolve through one of the examples in the patent describing that in this embodiment Siri can answer the front door and mediate interactions with guests.</p>

<p>“This is a far more sophisticated Siri that has high context and uses a shared blackboard system to interact. We can see Apple diving far deeper into the home with ambient Voice-First technology. There are a lot of embodiments that go even deeper into how the new Siri platform will extend in this patent,” Roemmele adds.</p>

<p>2. Amazon</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/multiplex/meet-the-echo-show-amazons-new-voice-first-device-with-a-screen-and-a-camera-e4d47bba3f20">Amazon’s latest release of the feature-rich voice-first device with a screen and a camera has been well-reviewed under the microscope</a>, bringing together:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Alexa Platform</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fire Tablet Platform</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chime Platform</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/?sc_channel=PS&amp;sc_campaign=acquisition_US&amp;sc_publisher=google&amp;sc_medium=rekognition_b&amp;sc_content=aws_recognition_software_phrase&amp;sc_detail=amazon%20rekognition&amp;sc_category=rekognition&amp;sc_segment=179121319162&amp;sc_matchtype=p&amp;sc_country=us&amp;s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!179121319162!p!!g!!amazon%20rekognition&amp;ef_id=WMuJigAABFz03-O6:20170520070723:s">The Rekognition Platform</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The SnapTell/Flow Platform</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Amazon is also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/20/15368568/amazon-lex-alexa-chatbot-tools-ai-platform">making its voice-control technology available to all, giving developers access to the same tools that power its digital assistant Alexa</a>. The platform is called Amazon Lex, and bundles in both speech recognition, text recognition, and conversational interactions. It was first announced in a “preview phase” in <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-lex-coming-to-just-about-anything-near-you/">late 2016</a>, but according to a new <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-cloud-idUSKBN17L2FY">report from Reuters</a>, it is now rolling out to all developers.</p>

<p>3. Google</p>

<p><a href="http://readmultiplex.com/2017/05/17/google-assistant-get-smarter-gets-a-lens-and-does-voice-commerce/">Google Assistant rapidly gains functionality, and gets smarter</a> in understanding and performing a variety of tasks. The assistant will be able to interact with other assistants, manage calendars. Among other things, Roemmele notes 70 different smart home manufacturers that will work with Google Home, an open developer platform to add more.</p>

<p>Moreover, just recently, on May 18th, Google was <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/05/google-adding-shared-rooms-feature-youtube-vr.html">reported</a> to be adding a shared rooms feature to YouTube VR as part of an update to the app as well as an update to the Daydream platform in general. The feature is not live yet and won’t be added into the app until later in 2017; but once it launches, YouTube users will be able to do things like engage in voice chat and watch 360-degree videos together for a unique way to experience YouTube that is more akin to enjoying content together with friends who may be in the same room. Users will be able to enter into a shared room for a specific 360-degree video and their personas will be represented by the likes of 3-dimensional avatars.</p>

<p>4. Facebook</p>

<p>Facebook is <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-next-big-thing-augmented-reality-mark-zuckerberg-2017-4">now betting its future on augmented reality</a>, the nascent technology that promises to overlay virtual information onto the real world and eventually replace smartphones with something like a pair of glasses or even contact lenses.</p>

<p>5. Insurance and the financial services industry examples, demonstrating the expansion of interactive dimensions</p>

<p>Voice Recognition technology is already gaining traction in the insurance industry, <a href="https://www.chipin.com/voice-tech-revolution-banking-fintech/">Chipin</a> reports. In early January 2017, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/05/japanese-company-replaces-office-workers-artificial-intelligence-ai-fukoku-mutual-life-insurance">Fukoku Mutual Life decided to replace 34 employees with IBM’s Watson Explorer AI,</a> which is capable of analyzing and interpreting an unstructured text, audio, and video data to calculate payouts.</p>

<p>In December 2016, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/12/13/cortana-skills-kit-cortana-devices-sdk-announcement/#0jHFvfoV1TdtRqP8.97">Capital One became the first financial institution to sign up for Cortana</a> and leverage existing investments in voice technology to enable customers to efficiently manage their money through a hands-free, natural language conversation with Cortana.</p>

<h3 id="one-company-leapfrogged-the-whole-world-in-delivering-unprecedented-computingprocessing-power-and-its-neither-a-financial-services-company-nor-a-fintech-startup">One company leapfrogged the whole world in delivering unprecedented computing/processing power (and it’s neither a financial services company nor a FinTech startup).</h3>

<p>The underlying advantage that FinTech startups had over institutional solutions for a long time was the technology component. But just a few days ago, even FinTech superiority has been overshadowed by a company that has a very remote connection to financial services and FinTech – IBM.</p>

<p>The Big Blue announced <a href="http://newatlas.com/ibm-next-quantum-processors/49590/">the prototype of the first commercial quantum computing processor</a>. It’s an industry-first initiative to build commercially available universal quantum computers for business and science. Professionals <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/17/ibm-quantum-q-experience-qubits-most-powerful-processor-yet/">emphasize</a> that by thinking beyond ones and zeroes, the platform can already solve problems that were considered too complex for classical computer systems to handle – which means it can solve problems that we haven’t even thought of yet in fields like pharmaceuticals, artificial intelligence, financial services, and logistics.</p>

<p>While technologies like AI can find patterns buried in vast amounts of existing data, quantum computers will deliver solutions to important problems where patterns cannot be found and the number of possibilities that you need to explore to get to the answer is too enormous ever to be processed by classical computers. With its initiative, IBM invites interested parties to join it in exploring what might be possible with this new and vastly different approach to computing.</p>

<p>IBM Q has successfully built and tested two of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/17/ibm-quantum-q-experience-qubits-most-powerful-processor-yet/">most powerful universal quantum computing processors to date</a>, shadowing Watson: 16 qubits for public use and a 17 qubit prototype commercial processor. In an instant, a large technology corporation <a href="https://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q/resources/quantum-volume.pdf">took away the technological competitive advantage</a> that startups had in such data-focused segments as RegTech, AI, robo-advisors, trading and investment platforms, and any other segment that feeds its innovation off of the capability to process and drive value from enormous and complex data, structured and unstructured.</p>

<p>“The significant engineering improvements announced today will allow IBM to scale future processors to include 50 or more qubits, and demonstrate computational capabilities beyond today’s classical computing systems,” <a href="http://newatlas.com/ibm-next-quantum-processors/49590/">says</a> Arvind Krishna, director of IBM Research and Hybrid Cloud. “These powerful upgrades to our quantum systems, delivered via the IBM Cloud, allow us to imagine new applications and new frontiers for discovery that are virtually unattainable using classical computers alone.”</p>

<h2 id="a-few-things-we-should-learn-from-mentioned-examples">A few things we should learn from mentioned examples</h2>

<p>The next big thing in FinTech, and in the financial services industry overall, will not be always powered by ‘discoveries’ within either, but from the environment that comprises the foundation of any solution – the underlying hardware and technology. The next leap will be perpetuated by technology companies that define modern standards and advancements in computing/processing power and accessibility of those capabilities for commercial use. ‘Regular’ data centers will no longer ensure long-term sustainability for solutions that are run in the cloud on their rails.</p>

<p>Startups in any segment that ground their competitive advantage in anything that has to do with driving value from, or dealing with data and information, should consider an upgrade to the different level of processing capabilities + understand how interactive interfaces evolve to deliver that value through the right channel. Those segments include, but are not limited to, the ones developing AI solutions, RegTech, investments, and trading, robo-advisors (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2cfc2524-fe0b-11e6-96f8-3700c5664d30">JPMorgan already casts doubt over the future of robo-advisors</a>).</p>

<p>Traditional interfaces are challenged by external stakeholders (Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple) in two ways – voice assistants and VR. Connected assistants become smarter and add functionality with the enhancement of NLP and image recognition. Betting on physical interfaces, and mobile, in particular, can no longer ensure long-term relevance as voice-first solutions evolve. With <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-why-facebooks-mark-zuckerberg-wants-to-kill-the-smartphone-with-ar-2017-4">Facebook obsessed on killing the smartphone</a> to own a virtual space, classic interfaces and solutions developed for them will gradually fall out of grace.</p>

                    <p><strong>“Everything that can be automated, will be automated.”</strong>
-Shoshana Zuboff, Rtd. Prof. HBS</p>

<p>The aliens are coming. Well, they are already here.</p>

<p>Sounds absurd, but we are no less alien to what we were a decade ago. And our near future self will be much more alien to what we are today.</p>

<p><em>“With the IoT, we’re headed to a world where things aren’t liable to break catastrophically – or at least we’ll have a hell of a heads’ up. We’re headed to a world where our doors unlock when they sense us nearby.”</em> <strong>– ____Scott Weiss, Venture Capitalist, Andreessen Horowitz</strong></p>

<h4 id="changing-dynamics"><strong>Changing Dynamics</strong></h4>

<p>Imagine a scenario where we are granted access to offices, boardrooms, cafeterias, gymnasiums, theaters and our own homes by the flick of a wrist. Where we can control the temperature and humidity of our rooms, or set the kitchen apparatus to prepare our favorite delicacy from miles away.</p>

<p><em>**Where we can pay our bills and buy stuff without carrying cash or cards. Where our car knows how to pay for its fuel, our refrigerator knows what to order, our garden waters itself, the music we hear continues playing in different locations as we move from our home to the car, to the office or to wherever we are headed. **</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Or while on vacation, our smartphones being alerted of smoke emanating from our kitchen and the firemen having arrived to take care of any exigency scenario. Our home insurance company being informed about the damages due to fire, and being presented a check or a direct transfer note on arrival back home by the insurance company.</em></strong></p>

<p><em>**Where insurance companies will provide a reduced premium based on our lifestyle, making more money available for other spends. **</em></p>

<p><em>**Where the utility companies are updated by our scheduling systems, wherein they can estimate the usage of power, water, telephone, the internet and similar consumables, and calibrate their systems to supply as much leading to optimum supply and reduced wastage, thereby increasing operational and distributional efficiencies. **</em></p>

<p>All these scenarios have a great impact on how technology will change our lives for good. The transparency and efficiency will allow the human mind to focus on higher and creative objectives. Finances will improve with better utilization of resources and wealth. Here are some of the examples that will soon, if not already, bear out the resemblance to what was once thought to be alien:</p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">A company in Sweden is [implanting ](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-31042477)a chip – the size of a grain of rice – in the wrists of its workers. This will allow the workers to open doors, authenticate on photocopy machines, pay for coffee, access public utilities without having to carry any access card or a credit card.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Turbines, motors and other [machinery ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKBTwWU0W4U)in power generating or manufacturing plants will be able to communicate their wear and tear parameters by themselves to the engineers/maintenance staff, thereby reducing the need for engineers to collect this data manually.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">[Connected](https://youtu.be/z5pvLx7TMR0) and [driverless ](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/20/tesla-fully-self-driving-car-watch-video-could-pick-you-up-from-across-the-country.html)cars will give rise to an entirely new industry that will disrupt many of the existing established industries.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The banking [experience ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOBGz0iTovk)is about to be revamped with the innovative use of IoT.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">IoT enabling the management of [hospitals](https://youtu.be/kBqKjlPGE6I). The entire hospital, with its beds, operation theaters, emergency areas, etc., are all IoT-enabled, allowing live data feeds to a Wall of Analytics that GE has created at the Johns Hopkins Command Center.</li>
</ul>
<p>When things are automated, more time will be available to us humans as a society. This additional time can be spent in creative pursuits, and returning to living as we are supposed to while the worldly tasks are taken care of by automation. It is not very difficult to imagine the future of the world we live in, making our passage through the world an awesome experience.</p>

<p>The IoT moment is similar to the moment when the Internet hit us. Today, it is almost impossible to envision a world without the use of the internet. IoT will be the same in the coming decade, if not years. It looks like a one-way passage and hence, needs careful consideration before we tread on it wholeheartedly. Learning from our recent internet experience, standards can be evolved to ensure we do not go down a rabbit hole in our fantasy of a near-perfect world.</p>

<h4 id="challenges-and-impediments"><strong>Challenges and Impediments</strong></h4>

<p>To make IoT adoption a reality we still have to overcome challenges that might make our progress slower. Listed below are some impediments to the fast adoption of IOT:</p>

<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">Change is always difficult to accept.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">We have a plethora of legacy systems, devices, machinery and mindsets that needs to be upgraded to the IOT-enabled state.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"> As we delegate our work to machines, accidents are likely before we perfect the art.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Security and impersonation are aspects that need to be thought through with more clarity, so as to not invade privacy.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Questions like *“What will humans do when everything is automated?”* need to be addressed, philosophically as well as emotionally.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the fast advancement in our recent times, the time is not far when these questions will have satisfactory, if not perfect, answers. And then it is over to the aliens within humanity to forever change the way life was lived over millennia.</p>

<p>Hail the Internet Of Things!</p>

                <link>http://localhost:4000/2017/03/22/civic-tech-and-govtech-an-overlooked-lucrative-opportunity-for-technology-startups/</link>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Civic technology, or Civic Tech, is <a href="http://www.govtech.com/civic/What-is-Civic-Tech.html">defined</a> as a technology that enables greater participation in government or otherwise assists government in delivering citizen services and strengthening ties with the public. In other words, Civic Tech is where the public lends its talents, usually voluntarily, to help government do a better job. Moreover, <a href="https://www.omidyar.com/sites/default/files/file_archive/Pdfs/Engines%2520of%2520Change%2520-%2520Final.pdf">Omidyar Network</a> (which invested over <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/annefield/2016/06/11/why-there-isnt-more-of-a-hullabaloo-about-civic-tech/#1e0b654e2989">$90 million across 35 civic tech organizations</a> over the past decade) emphasizes that like a movement, civic tech is mission-driven, focused on making a change that benefits the public, and in most cases enables better public input into decision making.</p>

<p>As an emerging sector, Civic Tech is <a href="https://www.omidyar.com/sites/default/files/file_archive/Pdfs/Engines%2520of%2520Change%2520-%2520Final.pdf">defined</a> as incorporating any technology that is used to empower citizens or help make government more accessible, efficient, and effective. Civic tech isn’t just talk, Omidyar notes, it is a community of people coming together to create tangible projects and take action. <a href="http://www.govtech.com/civic/Civic-Tech-Movement-Uses-Data-to-Make-a-Real-Difference.html">The civic tech and open data movements have grown with the ubiquity of personal technology</a>.</p>

<p>Civic tech can be defined as a convergence of various fields. An example of such convergence has been given by <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/">Knight Foundation</a>, a national foundation with a goal to foster informed and engaged communities to power a healthy democracy:</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/A-7790bd.png" alt="A-7790bd.png" /></p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.knightfoundation.org/media/uploads/publication_pdfs/knight-civic-tech.pdf">The Emergence of Civic Tech: Investments in a Growing Field</a></p>

<p>In the report called <a href="https://www.omidyar.com/sites/default/files/file_archive/Pdfs/Engines%2520of%2520Change%2520-%2520Final.pdf">Engines of Change: What Civic Tech Can Learn From Social Movements</a>, Civic Tech is divided into three categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Citizen to Citizen (C2C): Technology that improves citizen mobilization or improves connections between citizens</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Citizen to Government (C2G): Technology that improves the frequency or quality of interaction between citizens and government</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government Technology (Govtech): Innovative technology solutions that make government more efficient and effective at service delivery</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In 2015, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikemontgomery/2015/06/24/why-civic-tech-is-the-next-big-thing/#3276ae09369a">Forbes</a> reported that Civic Tech makes up almost a quarter of local and state government spendings on technology. More importantly, spending on Civic Tech is growing 14 times faster than spending on traditional technology. The third category, GovTech, is a particularly interesting one given that <a href="http://govtechfund.com/2016/01/govtech-the-400-billion-market-hiding-in-plain-sight/">governments spend $400+ Billion dollars a year on GovTech</a>. The US government, in particular, is a massive entity that requires collaboration from the tech community to run it effectively (it employs roughly 15% of the entire US labor force, making it the single largest enterprise in America, as the Govtech Fund <a href="http://govtechfund.com/2016/01/govtech-the-400-billion-market-hiding-in-plain-sight/">reports</a>).</p>

<p>Civic tech initiatives address a diverse range of industries – from energy and payments to agriculture and telecommunications. <a href="https://mattermark.com/civic-tech-promises-better-government-society-faces-uphill-battle/">Mattermark</a> outlines the following top ten industries associated with government and civic tech:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Finance (<a href="https://opengov.com/">OpenGov</a>, <a href="http://www.valorwater.com/">Valor Water Analytics</a>, <a href="http://www.govsense.com/">GovSense</a>, <a href="http://munetrix.com/">Munetrix</a>, <a href="http://payitgov.com/">PayIt</a>, <a href="https://www.meterfeeder.com/">Meter Feeder</a>, <a href="https://www.municode.com/">Municode</a>, <a href="http://www.egov.com/what-we-do">NIC</a>, etc.)</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>A company that’s not been mentioned yet, but certainly deserves a special attention is <a href="https://www.ayasdi.com/">Ayasdi</a>, which counts the US government as a client among major consumer brands and financial institutions. While the world is looking for the next big thing among newcomers, the real big thing – Ayasdi – is gradually conquering the most powerful players across industries.</p>

<p>Ayasdi helps companies around the world use artificial intelligence to automate business processes formerly thought of as exclusively in the domain of humans, to enable intelligent applications that augment and even surpass human capabilities and to make new discoveries in big data and high dimensional data. Developed by Stanford computational mathematicians, Ayasdi’s unique approach to machine intelligence leverages breakthrough mathematics, highly-automated software and inexpensive, scalable computers to revolutionize the process of converting big data into business impact.</p>

<p>The company gathered quite an influential ‘fan club,’ counting among clients Credit Suisse, Citi, United States Federal Reserve System, Siemens, The US Department of Homeland Security, UCSF, USDA, The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), United States Department of Defense, Merck, and <a href="https://www.ayasdi.com/customers/">more</a>. Ayasdi built partnerships with companies like Deloitte, Cloudera, Hortonworks, Intel, Teradata, among <a href="https://www.ayasdi.com/company/partners/">others</a>, not mentioning notable <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/companies/ayasdi">investors</a>.</p>

<p>There are certainly much more <a href="http://www.govtech.com/100/">examples of GovTech/civic tech companies</a>, and just <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/fintech-companies-on-a-mission-to-help-the-business-of-government/">tech startups</a> offering solutions across the board that can significantly improve the way governments are run, and services are delivered to citizens and businesses. More importantly, GovTech should no longer be considered a charity and solely non-profit type of venture. Recently reviewed global <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/p2g-payments-an-overlooked-8-trillion-dollar-opportunity-for-the-global-startup-ecosystem/">P2G payments</a> flows only, for example, are estimated to be at $7.7 trillion and represent a significant feature of the global payments landscape. For the low- and lower-middle-income countries alone, the number hits <a href="http://karandaaz.com.pk/P2G-landscape-study">$375 billion</a> (~50% of annual government expenditure).</p>

<p>As we have emphasized earlier, <a href="http://govtechfund.com/2016/01/govtech-the-400-billion-market-hiding-in-plain-sight/">governments spend $400+ billion dollars a year on GovTech</a>, and a range of startups are already <a href="http://www.govtech.com/civic/Gov-Tech-Companies-Are-Finding-Business-Model.html">shaping their businesses models to take advantage of a largely overlooked around the world opportunity</a>.</p>

                <title>How AI Will Become the Most Defining Technology for the Banking Industry</title>
                <link>http://localhost:4000/2017/02/08/how-ai-will-become-the-most-defining-technology-for-the-banking-industry/</link>
                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Artificial intelligence is here to stay, and <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/stormy-sea-of-fraud-in-2017/">2017 will be about the adoption of ML/AI</a> by the FinTech community and beyond. Experts agree that <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/hottest-fintech-trends-2017/">FinTech companies will harness this technology to make better decisions and offer improved solutions</a> – they will make use of predictive analytics to break down big data and analyze large volumes of consumer information.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/regtech/">Henri Arslanian</a>, PwC’s FinTech and RegTech Lead for China/HK, emphasizes a particular area of focus for AI adoption, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/10-fintech-predictions-for-asia-in-2017/">saying</a>, “While the focus in the media is often on AI replacing human fund managers or traders, the most pressing use cases may be <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/application-of-ai-in-regtech/">cost reduction or compliance issues</a> – where AI helps banks in their anti-money laundering or employee misconduct detection efforts by replacing costly functions that are currently done manually by humans.”</p>

<p>A variety of financial institutions have turned from words to actions, adopting ML/AI in various areas of operations. One of the latest and probably most vivid indicators of transformative processes in banking is Goldman Sachs, which brings significant automation into areas of trading like currencies and futures using complex trading algorithms, some with machine learning capabilities. According to the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603431/as-goldman-embraces-automation-even-the-masters-of-the-universe-are-threatened/">MIT Review</a>, the number of US cash equities trading desk at Goldman Sachs’s New York headquarters employees went from 600 in 2000 to just two equity traders and automated trading programs supported by 200 computer engineers doing the rest of work.</p>

<p>The application of AI for GS goes beyond trading automation. The bank has strong ties (as a customer and as an investor) with AI software provider <a href="http://www.digitalreasoning.com/">Digital Reasoning</a>, whose solution GS <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2016/11/07/wall-streets-big-brother-the-startup-goldman-sachs-and-steve-cohen-are-using-to-track-traders/#4138c6e3b13e">uses to track traders</a>. The same startup has also launched a program with NASDAQ to use its AI technology to track trading data, communications, emails, chats and even voice data to ferret out misconduct across the entire electronic stock exchange.</p>

<p>Moreover, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/the-robots-are-coming-for-wall-street.html?_r=0">Goldman Sachs uses the machine learning platform Kensho to mine data from the National Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> and compile all that information into regular summaries. The reports feature 13 exhibits predicting stock performances based on similar employment changes in the past, and they’re ready to print just nine minutes after the data is entered.</p>

<p>But let’s move to some other interesting examples – HDFC, ICICI, BofA, Charles Schwab and JP Morgan among other institutions, that Citi has revealed to be <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/applying-ai-for-a-better-tomorrow/">applying AI across numerous use cases</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/sdvsdv.png" alt="sdvsdv.png" /></p>

<p>In December 2016, <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/hdfc-bank-nikiai-tie-up-for-chatbot-banking/articleshow/56214957.cms">HDFC Bank tied up with AI firm Niki.ai to bring in “conversational banking”</a> – chatbots that facilitate commerce and banking transactions without getting out of the chat window. The chatbot is presently available on Facebook messenger where it can be used for e-commerce transactions like booking a cab, ordering food or paying bills.</p>

<p>The tie-up is aligned with the vision that HDFC executives have for the future of banking: “The two-three most promising areas where digital advances could revolutionize the customer experience are artificial intelligence, chatbots and personalization,” <a href="https://www.hdfcbank.com/htdocs/aboutus/News_Room/pdf/MEDIA_COVERAGE_Mr_Nitin_Chugh_This_is_how_future_of_digital_banking_looks_like.pdf">said</a> Nitin Chugh, Country Head – Digital Banking.</p>

<p>HDFC is not the only bank bringing AI into customer touchpoints. Earlier that year, AI startup <a href="http://kasisto.com/">Kasisto</a> <a href="http://kasisto.com/ai-driven-virtual-assistant-from-kasisto-powers-indias-first-mobile-only-bank/">announced</a> that its KAI platform is powering the virtual assistant in DBS’s mobile-only bank <a href="https://www.dbs.com/digibank/in">digibank</a>. In fact, the virtual digital assistant (VDA) market is <a href="https://ir.citi.com/5X%2BQYT5l2T%2BYUV4%2FL%2FhUjyK%2B0cD27TLg380o6tX3OwKdy7TrZXEKM9ByXlGUuCvXEjpUnEPhKoU%3D">estimated</a> to reach $15.8 billion worldwide by 2021 with unique active consumer VDA users growing to 1.8 billion, and enterprise VDA users rising to 843 million.</p>

<p>One of the pioneers in bringing early AI tools into banking/trading was Charles Schwab, which way back in <a href="http://pressroom.aboutschwab.com/press-release/schwab-investor-services-news/charles-schwab-launch-new-platform-active-traders">2011</a> started applying <a href="http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/articles/Automated-Chart-Pattern-Recognition">chart pattern recognition</a> designed to simplify complex trading activities and provide a more intuitive experience for active traders. Nowadays, Charles Schwab is way ahead – <a href="https://intelligent.schwab.com/">Schwab Intelligent Portfolios</a> is a fully automated investment advisory service by Charles Schwab, which, being launched in March 2015, by the end of June had grown to more than <a href="http://etfdb.com/interviews/schwab-intelligent-portfolios/">$3 billion</a> in assets under management and more than 39,000 accounts.</p>

<p>Ravi Narayanan, Country Head – Branch Banking and Retail Trade FX Business, HDFC, <a href="https://www.hdfcbank.com/htdocs/aboutus/News_Room/pdf/ET-aug022016.pdf">emphasized</a> that AI will be the most defining technology for banking industry. Given the variety of use cases that financial institutions have found for the advanced technology and undebatable benefits for organizations and customers, Narayanan is certainly not overestimating the value of AI in finances.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>There is enough said about <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/global-fintech-funding-36-bn-2016/">the scale of the FinTech industry</a>, its <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-role-of-mobile-money-in-democratizing-international-remittances-and-driving-financial-inclusion/">inclusive agenda</a> and <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/88-international-startup-accelerators-incubators-innovation-labs-nurturing-innovators-in-financial-services/">massive surrounding ecosystem</a>, but the real value of this industry is not in millions that are moving around in funding, expansion and acquisition deals. The value is measured in micro-processes, in the real, everyday difference FinTech startups make for small businesses and individuals.</p>

<p>One of the most important <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/what-makes-fintech-a-vital-element-of-the-international-ecosystem-infographic/">hallmarks of the FinTech community</a> is its focus on solving cumbersome operational problems, allowing business leaders to recalibrate resource allocation (talent, financial resources) to deliver value to their clients rather than to simply remain afloat in a highly competitive market. Let’s look at three illustrative examples of FinTech companies that make a real difference:</p>

<h2 id="there-is-much-more-to-business-banking-than-a-business-account">There is much more to business banking than a business account</h2>

<p>Entrepreneurship is a rough terrain that often discourages one from the journey. Regardless, talented professionals around the world still choose to build a successful business from the ground up, to see it grow and blossom. Business banking, hence, is an important niche in the financial services industry – moving billions internationally and ensuring security and compliance. The caveat with the traditional sector, however, is that business banking is mostly limited to providing a bank account and a line of business credit rather than getting mixed in other aspects of business operations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, for startups/small businesses and entrepreneurs, those operations are the backbone of the business and often present a challenge to smoothen up to focus on more important things – delivering a value. That’s where FinTech makes a difference – companies similar to <a href="https://about.holvi.com/">Holvi</a> are not limited to providing a bank account, they are building services that make entrepreneurs’ everyday life easier.</p>

<p><a href="https://about.holvi.com/">Holvi</a> is the world’s first financial hub operating with its own Payment Institution License authorized for operations across Europe by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Finland (FIN-FSA). It’s everything a business needs – an account, paperless bookkeeping and easier invoicing. The company allows entrepreneurs to set up and run an online store in just a few clicks with no need for expensive software or coding skills. Its fully integrated with business account and bookkeeping. Sales are tracked and recorded automatically so business owners can focus on getting more, rather than copying the details of previous sales into accounting software.</p>

<p>While one set of companies takes care of everyday background operations, another set solves an issue even more complex – tax and compliance. <a href="http://simpletax.co/">Simple Tax</a>, <a href="https://www.satago.com/">Satago</a>, a whole set of <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/companies?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;page=1&amp;term=&amp;q%5Brocket_eq%5D=0&amp;term=&amp;q%5Bname_cont%5D=&amp;q%5Bcountry_eq%5D=&amp;q%5Btotal_funding_amount_value_gt%5D=0&amp;q%5Btotal_funding_amount_value_lt%5D=2430000000.0&amp;q%5Bfunding_stage_eq%5D=&amp;q%5Bemployees_amount_gt%5D=0&amp;q%5Bemployees_amount_lt%5D=2300000&amp;q%5Btags%5D%5B%5D=RegTech">RegTech companies</a> are <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/regtech-cost-efficient-data-management-reporting-solutions/">unleashing the innovative capacity of businesses with cost-efficient data management and reporting solutions</a>.</p>

<p>RegTech deserves a special attention here – the whole segment forever shuttered the traditional approach to handling compliance and presented the market with over a hundred <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/companies?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;page=1&amp;term=&amp;q%5Brocket_eq%5D=0&amp;term=&amp;q%5Bname_cont%5D=&amp;q%5Bcountry_eq%5D=&amp;q%5Btotal_funding_amount_value_gt%5D=0&amp;q%5Btotal_funding_amount_value_lt%5D=2430000000.0&amp;q%5Bfunding_stage_eq%5D=&amp;q%5Bemployees_amount_gt%5D=0&amp;q%5Bemployees_amount_lt%5D=2300000&amp;q%5Btags%5D%5B%5D=RegTech">RegTech innovators</a>, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/application-of-ai-in-regtech/">applying the power of modern technological advancements to compliance</a>. Within itself, RegTech is a diverse community of bright entrepreneurs solving various regulation-related problems for businesses and financial services companies, in particular, KYC/CDD, AML, risk management, market surveillance, fraud detection, etc. In that regard, RegTech ‘shares a wall’ with FinTech startups that are offering solutions for same problems, but are not particularly compliance-oriented – <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/companies?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;page=1&amp;term=&amp;q%5Brocket_eq%5D=0&amp;term=&amp;q%5Bname_cont%5D=&amp;q%5Bcountry_eq%5D=&amp;q%5Btotal_funding_amount_value_gt%5D=0&amp;q%5Btotal_funding_amount_value_lt%5D=2430000000.0&amp;q%5Bfunding_stage_eq%5D=&amp;q%5Bemployees_amount_gt%5D=0&amp;q%5Bemployees_amount_lt%5D=2300000&amp;q%5Btags%5D%5B%5D=Security\+-\+Fraud\+%26\+Authentication&amp;q%5Btags%5D%5B%5D=RegTech">cybersecurity companies, real-time fraud detection companies, a range of identity verification solutions</a>, etc.</p>

<p>The whole class of FinTech companies that focuses on ‘software-izing’, if we can call it so, the lawyer and an accountant, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/how-can-regtechs-help-financial-services-industry-overcome-the-burden-of-compliance/">tremendously eases the burden for small businesses</a> and allows the leadership to focus on the value of the business rather than ensuring no laws are broken and taxes are paid.</p>

<h2 id="transferring-money-is-no-longer-about-banks--its-about-people-and-their-experiences">Transferring money is no longer about banks – it’s about people and their experiences</h2>

<p>The value and the difference in approach to business banking brought by FinTech is clear. What about individuals? P2P money transfer services landscape is vast and expanding at the speed of light. While incumbent P2P transfer services are mostly about getting the bank info right, FinTech alternatives are mainly just about knowing who you are sending money to.</p>

<p><a href="https://venmo.com/">Venmo</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/wallet/?gclid=CJC36JWX39ECFcdhfgod4p4JvA">Google Wallet</a>, Facebook Messenger, <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/companies?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;page=1&amp;term=&amp;q%5Brocket_eq%5D=0&amp;term=&amp;q%5Bname_cont%5D=&amp;q%5Bcountry_eq%5D=&amp;q%5Btotal_funding_amount_value_gt%5D=0&amp;q%5Btotal_funding_amount_value_lt%5D=2430000000.0&amp;q%5Bfunding_stage_eq%5D=&amp;q%5Bemployees_amount_gt%5D=0&amp;q%5Bemployees_amount_lt%5D=2300000&amp;q%5Btags%5D%5B%5D=P2P\+Payments">etc.</a>, made user experience the priority over the transaction itself. FinTech companies moved the movement of funds and bank account information to the background, focusing on the context, UI/UX and social aspect of sending money. Needless to say, they have hit a goldmine in the redefinition of money transfer services.</p>

<p>Following the steps of heavyweights in P2P payments, <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/companies?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;page=1&amp;term=&amp;q%5Brocket_eq%5D=0&amp;term=&amp;q%5Bname_cont%5D=&amp;q%5Bcountry_eq%5D=&amp;q%5Btotal_funding_amount_value_gt%5D=0&amp;q%5Btotal_funding_amount_value_lt%5D=2430000000.0&amp;q%5Bfunding_stage_eq%5D=&amp;q%5Bemployees_amount_gt%5D=0&amp;q%5Bemployees_amount_lt%5D=2300000&amp;q%5Btags%5D%5B%5D=P2P\+Payments">hundreds of mobile wallets</a> offer seamless payments experiences with variations in scale, integration capabilities and more. The <a href="http://tagcash.org/">Tag Group</a>, for one, is an example of a comprehensive approach to payments and commerce operating: <a href="http://tagcash.com/">Tag Cash</a> (a payments solution in Philippines), Tag Cash NFC (stored-value closed loop currency), <a href="http://tagwild.com/">TagWild</a> (gamification of loyalty), <a href="http://tagbond.com/">TagBond</a> (store information or anything or anyone), <a href="http://tag77.com/">Tag77</a> (event and ticket management) and <a href="http://miskio.com/">TagLink</a> (allows businesses to find new customers, manage and keep them).</p>

                <title>In the World of Invisible Payments</title>

                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>The invisibility of certain financial services is a cornerstone of a seamless experience, contributing to the usage growth and expanded opportunities for businesses. Invisible and uninterrupted payments experience, in particular, can have a dramatic impact on any type of service adoption and drive never seen before growth in sales across industries, especially retail and commerce.</p>

<p>“In a way, invisible payments can make payments a more integrated, intuitive part of the user experience. The best user experience removes as many pain points as possible no matter the location of the user or the brand they’re interacting with,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-francis-b2a89b2">Chris Francis</a>, Vice President of Market Development at <a href="http://www.worldpay.us/">WorldPay</a> <a href="https://pointofsale.com/2016091214011/Payment-Processing/Invisible-Payments-Making-Dining-and-Dashing-Acceptable.html">suggests</a>.</p>

<p>Today, however, the opportunity with invisible <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/global-fintech-funding-36-bn-2016/">payments</a> services is yet to be explored as existing widely adopted security solutions and payment technologies do not allow <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/journey-to-invisible-authentication/">a completely non-interactive experience authorizing a transaction</a>. Nonetheless, given that today’s consumer doesn’t want to wait for anything, the introduction of invisible, instant payments are a natural course of action for businesses and financial institutions to keep up with market demands.</p>

<p>In the world of invisible payments, the friction and necessity for a human intervention are removed from everyday activities involving any financial transaction. So far, Amazon has come the closest to bringing the idea into reality with its concept of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=16008589011">Amazon Go</a> store, eliminating the whole part of standing in lines to make a payment as the payment experience itself is removed from the most payment-centered activity – <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/top-ways-online-retailers-can-make-shopping-safer-this-holiday-season/">shopping</a>. Amazon Go’s Just Walk Out Technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When the customer is done shopping, he/she can just leave the store. Shortly after, Amazon charges person’s Amazon account and sends a receipt.</p>

<p>Google has also been working in the same direction with its <a href="https://get.google.com/handsfree/">Hands Free App</a> that allows users to make in-store payments without ever reaching for the phone or wallet. The app is currently running a limited public pilot in a small number of Silicon Valley stores. The Hands Free app uses Bluetooth low energy, Wi-Fi, location settings, and other sensors on customers’ phone to detect whether the person is near a participating store. This enables users to pay hands-free, without fumbling with the phone or even opening the Hands Free app.</p>

<p>The search company, however, did not completely remove the payment moment from the shopping experience – a person still needs to go through the cashier and indicate a desire to pay with Google. After that, the cashier confirms customer’s identity, using initials and the photo that the customer added to Hands Free profile. At some stores, Google is also running very early experiments using visual identification to further simplify the checkout process. All images and data from the Hands Free in-store camera are used only to confirm person’s identity for each Hands Free purchase. Images and data from the Hands Free in-store camera are deleted immediately; however, they can’t be accessed by the store, and are not sent to or saved to Google servers.</p>

<p>The development of <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/iot-powered-transformation-in-the-insurance-industry/">IoT technology</a> will play an imperative role in advancing invisible payments solutions running on the connectivity of personal devices, including vehicles, homes, laptops, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/wearable-technology-will-accelerate-the-adoption-of-biometric-technology/">wearables</a>, etc. The need for carrying a particular device (not speaking of wallets) will be eliminated as any tech carried by a person will be able to carry the same function. Equipped POS terminals then can interact with any personal devices with payment functionality to perform a transaction without the need for a person to interfere at all.</p>

<p>The seamless, invisible payment experience comes with certain possible drawbacks for the customer. With invisible payments, the traditional part of any service consumption – the payment for that service – is completely removed, thus, taking away a feeling of spending, which is a positive side for businesses, but removes the sense of reasonable spending behavior. Automatically deducted payment with no feeling and experience of making a payment at all allows customers to experience the product/service without the need to evaluate the deduction because the payment becomes literally invisible in the whole process. <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/chatbots-in-pfm-and-banking-from-apps-to-personal-bot-assistants/">PFM platforms</a> will ‘have a blast’ offering sophisticated strategies to save money when the numbed feeling of spending money will hit pockets.</p>

<p>At the moment, there is not much on financial institutions expressing interest in taking payments to the next level. Technology companies are more likely to beat banks in regard to invisible payments because for banks, the technology will eliminate the part of the business revolving around credit/debit cards and proprietary <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/mobile-wallets-when-too-many-pays-wont-let-anyone-win/">payments apps</a> loaded with those cards. Therefore, financial institutions may take some time to catch up or miss out on the opportunity at all in their attempt to keep banking apps relevant. With invisible payments, financial institutions will have to forsake cards and invest significantly in the development of features allowing a hands-free payment. At the end, while technology companies can focus on providing the best possible payments experience, banks are the ones moving money and risking own capital in case the security is compromised in favor of that experience.</p>

<p>Invisible payments can change the experience beyond shopping. Professionals from <a href="https://www.tonetag.com/">ToneTag</a> <a href="http://tonetag.com/blog/mobile-payments/why-invisible-payments-is-the-best-thing-in-payments-since-contactless/">bring examples</a> of toll plazas and metro turnstiles – invisible payments would allow people to drive or walk across without stopping to pay every morning.</p>

<p>In the restaurant business, certain startups are already appropriating the dine-and-dash culture. As <a href="https://upnext.io/invisible-payments">reported by Upnext</a>, using beacons with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology, companies like <a href="http://paywithdash.com/">Dash</a>, <a href="https://reserve.com/">Reserve</a>, and <a href="https://tabpayments.co/">Tab</a> allow diners to pay quickly and easily by just saying their name to the waiter or barman. All these apps turn dining out into an experience that’s only about the food, the people and the atmosphere – and not about the bill anymore. The app automatically bills the cost to the user’s card, which is stored securely in the cloud so there’s no need to call over a waiter or think about whether you have enough cash. Payment has become an automatic process that takes place in the background, the edition notes.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>There is little to no doubt that <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/say-goodbye-to-passwords-fido-to-revolutionize-online-authentication-systems/">passwords are on their way out of use</a> and relevance with <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/biometrics-in-banking-who-is-killing-the-passwords-in-2016/">more advanced solutions taking over the market</a>. But no matter what comes next, the most advanced solutions that are increasingly gaining attention and traction are making one major change in ensuring cybersecurity – they introduce invisible, non-interrupting methods of continuous authentication.</p>

<p>The vast majority of authentication methods nowadays are focused on building gateways by either <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/interview-with-early-warning-and-clearxchange-the-most-powerful-bank-focused-alliance-in-the-authentication-and-digital-payments-industry/">layering factors</a> in attempts to figure out the best combination, or using one particular access-blocking method – XFA has been around for a long time and is firmly rooted across industries. Regardless, all those solutions share one hallmark – an interrupted experience with a personal device or service.</p>

<p>At the same time, customers expect things to happen in nothing less than an instant – financial technology startups taught customers that <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/future-of-financial-services-mobile-and-instant/">for services to be relevant, they should expect them to be delivered now or never</a>. Therefore, the whole <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/companies?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;page=1&amp;term=&amp;q%5Brocket_eq%5D=0&amp;term=&amp;q%5Bname_cont%5D=&amp;q%5Bcountry_eq%5D=&amp;q%5Btotal_funding_amount_value_gt%5D=0&amp;q%5Btotal_funding_amount_value_lt%5D=2430000000.0&amp;q%5Bfunding_stage_eq%5D=&amp;q%5Bemployees_amount_gt%5D=0&amp;q%5Bemployees_amount_lt%5D=2300000&amp;q%5Btags%5D%5B%5D=Security\+-\+Fraud\+%26\+Authentication">class of solutions tailored to fortify personal devices and personal accounts from access by improper parties</a> is on a fast track to obsolescence.</p>

<p>Indeed, as fairly <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/molly-reynolds/5-hottest-trends-in-finte_b_13860654.html">noted</a> by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-dziabiak-686a686">Joshua Dziabiak</a>, Co-founder and COO of <a href="https://www.thezebra.com/">The Zebra</a>, “Consumer’s expectations are increasingly aligned with companies that provide immediate, alternative solutions to everyday life tasks. People expect things to be instant – whether you’re talking about a package delivered from Amazon Prime or a ride appearing at a swipe of their fingertips via Uber.”</p>

<p>Why should authentication be any different if the technology to ensure non-interruptive access to personal devices and accounts already exists (although, it does require a certain tuning)?</p>

<h2 id="invisible-continuous-authentication-will-enable-truly-seamless-user-experience-and-facilitate-commerce">Invisible continuous authentication will enable truly seamless user experience and facilitate commerce</h2>

<p>Any interruption of an online experience increases the chance of a customer growing tired and leaving it altogether. Just like with online shopping, when a customer is redirected off-site to make a payment, the <a href="https://woocommerce.com/2016/03/payment-gateway-ux/">chances are that there will be another abandoned cart</a>. With authentication for access to personal accounts via mobile, the story is similar – it’s additional friction while using a service, however convenient the method is – whether it’s a fingerprint, OTP, PIN, etc.</p>

<p>Instead of interactive authentication, invisible continuous profiling of the user can allow companies to accumulate enough data to truly understand who is using the service based on past usage patterns. No-barrier use of any service undoubtedly smoothens the experience and allows businesses to gather insight on a user’s in-app or online behavior, thus improving the quality of the invisible authentication method.</p>

<p>Modern devices are equipped with all sorts of sensors and most applications are able to track user activity in and even out of the app by getting broader access to the phone’s nooks. Therefore, modern technology and software are ready for the generation of authentication solutions that ensure the person is who he is supposed to be without the need to ask that person to authenticate himself. Behavior-based profiling allows users to freely operate in their personal devices, use services in apps and browsers – all while security solutions are closely monitoring and evaluating whether the behavioral pattern matches the owners’ every time.</p>

<p>One of the examples of such type of solutions is <a href="http://www.transmitsecurity.com/">Transmit Security</a>, which automatically learns each and every one of the client’s users: this includes the devices each customer uses, login times, login locations, navigation patterns, in-app activity, and more. Most importantly, the system understands the authentication steps each customer takes and what the impact is on their experience by evaluating factors like: how long did it take to complete? What was the failure rate? What is the abandon rate?</p>

<p>As the company <a href="http://www.transmitsecurity.com/use_case/primary-authentication-invisible/">describes</a> the concept of invisible authentication, based on the customer’s behavioral profile, the system makes decisions to minimize friction – it monitors customer activity inside applications and disables the need for interactive authentication as long as the customer remains within safe boundaries. Once the customer steps out of these boundaries, primary or secondary authentication processes are triggered.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.transmitsecurity.com/">Transmit Security</a> is not the first initiative with invisible authentication use case. Bank in 2014, a company called Toopher (<a href="https://www.toopher.com/">acquired</a> by Salesforce in 2015) developed and <a href="http://www.secureidnews.com/news-item/university-of-texas-deploys-invisible-authentication-technology-for-faculty-and-staff/">deployed a two-factor invisible authentication solution for the faculty and staff of the University of Texas</a>. At that time, the solution was focusing on location-based invisible authentication, which can be considered an earlier version of modern advanced invisible authentication solutions monitoring an array of behavioral patterns.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.secureidnews.com/news-item/toopher-enables-two-factor-invisible-authentication/">Toopher used the geolocation feature of the mobile device, learning where a user typically logged in to various sites</a>. If a login came from a location that is not typical, a request was sent to the mobile to further authenticate prior to allowing the transaction. The system could also be used to authorize only specific transactions from a provider’s suite of services, or to authenticate the identity.</p>

<p>The widely-recognized <a href="https://www.behaviosec.com/">BehavioSec</a> is another interesting company that offers a non-conventional approach to security and authentication with the use of <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/behaviometrics-will-define-the-new-era-of-security/">behaviometrics</a>, or behavioral biometrics. As the company defines the term,”behaviometrics is a measurable behavior used to recognize or verify the identity of a person. Behaviometrics focuses on behavioral patterns rather than physical attributes.” By continuously comparing different aspects of the current input stream with a previously stored user profile, behaviometrics can detect anomalies in the user’s behavior within seconds and stop intrusions while they are happening. If the behavior matches, the users get to enjoy an uninterrupted experience with their devices and personal accounts.</p>

<p>The number of elements characterizing behavioral patterns that devices can capture have expanded considerably along with the precision of behavioral profiling. The core idea behind all those solutions remains the same though – to ensure stronger security for whatever operations without having to interrupt the experience.</p>
