          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The WealthTech industry is one of the most promising areas attracting substantial funding, talent and, probably, the most active on events. </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/build-business-not-channel-launching-robo-advisor-inside-large-bank/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial institutions are aggressively pushing boundaries in response to the rise of tech rivals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And for a good reason – the UK Government estimates that robo-advisory solutions can extend financial opportunities for 16 million people in the country. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pick #1 The Investment Management Strategy II, HM Treasury </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WealthTech enables the provision of advice to mass-market segments, including those that have previously been unreached by financial advice. The FCA estimates that this could be as many as 16 million people in the UK alone. The industry has the opportunity to give millions of people better access to affordable financial advice that meets their needs at every stage of their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech innovations can also help asset managers reduce the number of intermediaries in an investment transaction, and therefore, bring down investment related costs. At present, some parts of the asset management industry rely heavily on companies that provide necessary intermediary services before making an investment transaction on clearing and settlement infrastructure. Disintermediation is the process of streamlining these intermediaries, making the system more efficient and transparent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domestically, FinTech firms have the opportunity to disrupt ways of doing business and bring down costs associated with making an investment to the benefit of the end-investor. One of the most notable emerging sub-sectors of FinTech is WealthTech. Focusing on enhancing wealth management and the retail investment process, WealthTech encompasses technologies derived from wealth management firms, research tools that generate investment solutions and platforms that support financial advisors. The most visible players in this FinTech sub-sector are online wealth managers, commonly known as robo-advisors. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pick #2 Bank of America Wins Patent for Crypto Exchange System</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a patent awarded by the US Patent and Trademark Office on Tuesday, the second-largest bank in the US </span><a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=1&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;S1=9,836,790.PN.&amp;OS=pn/9,836,790&amp;RS=PN/9,836,790"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outlined a potential cryptocurrency exchange system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would convert one digital currency into another. This system would be automated, establishing the exchange rate between the two currencies based on external data feeds. The proposed system would collect data from external information sources on cryptocurrency exchange rates and use this data to establish its own optimal rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The patent notes this service would be for enterprise-level customers. "Enterprises may handle a large number of financial transactions on a daily basis. As technology advances, financial transactions involving cryptocurrency have become more common. For some enterprises, it may be desirable to exchange currencies and cryptocurrencies."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed system could also evaluate transactions for potential illicit trades, calculating a risk score based on the amount of cryptocurrency being transferred and any other information available, according to the patent.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pick #3 The Tipping Point: Artificial Intelligence in B2B</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real, practical AI is much more than a few plug-and-play algorithms. It requires a sound strategy around desired business outcomes, targeted use cases, data assets, algorithms, high-scale computing, process integration, change management, incentive alignment, executive support, and accountability. Winners will make big bets, forging partnerships with experts in AI-driven business impact along with fostering system modernization to drive measurable, predictable and repeatable business value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advances in APIs are making it possible to plug in customer-specific intelligence across your entire tech stack, whether it’s the latest technology or the green screen that’s been on the shop floor for the past 30 years. Using AI to supercharge sales channels can also influence the channel mix. Delivering intelligence at all customer touch points means that customers have a consumer-like buying experience when they need to self-serve and an informed expert to speak with when they need it, too. Company leaders can easily pivot that mix, knowing that the AI-driven tech will continually serve up actionable intelligence, regardless of the channel.</span></p>

          <a href="/banking/insights/lending/2017/12/08/a-lesson-on-lending-alternative-lenders-and-community-banks/" class="post-link"><h3 class="h1 post-title">A Lesson on Lending: Alternative Lenders and Community Banks</h3></a>
          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine you are a small-business owner running a profitable family restaurant for several years and looking to expand to another location. To do this, you need a $70,000 loan, but your bank has declined your request. Rather than go to a different bank and complete another three-inch-thick loan application, you may decide to skip this time-consuming, manual application process and instead apply for a loan online through an alternative lender, which only takes a few minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps you are a millennial that wants to start a business. You would like to obtain a small business loan to accomplish this, but obtaining approval for a loan seems like a complex endeavor. Instead, you choose to rely on your personal credit to launch and grow your company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small-business lending is touted as a core component of the community banking business, but community banks often miss opportunities like those above, losing to alternative lenders and larger banks. With interest rates to continue rising in 2018, community banks cannot afford to bypass these revenue-generating opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a survey by the </span><a href="https://www.communitybanking.org/~/media/files/CB21pub_2017_BOOK_web.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Reserve and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, small business lending at community banks fell by 2.2% in 2016, while small business lending at banks with more than $10 billion in assets grew by 5.1%. Additionally, 26% of small businesses that sought funding in 2016 turned to alternative lenders, according to the </span><a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/smallbusiness/2016/SBCS-Report-EmployerFirms-2016.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Reserve’s 2016 Small Business Credit Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In short, today’s community banks are challenged with increased competition, from both banks and their non-bank counterparts, coupled with increasing customer demands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this, community banks are positioned to succeed in the small-business lending space if they can address their areas of weakness and build on their unique strengths. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example, banks have multiple cycles of performance data, which can support more powerful scenario analysis and comprehensive credit models. As economic conditions change, banks can more accurately predict how loan portfolio performance may shift. This is a considerable advantage in the lending space. Conversely, alternative lenders typically use credit models with a 12-month to 24-month loss curve, making it difficult for these lenders to predict how market fluctuations may affect portfolio performance. However, banks do not possess the same portfolio agility that alternative lenders do. Alternative lenders have the ability to make real-time adjustments to their credit model and quickly change their portfolios. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another strength that community banks and other deposit-accepting institutions possess is stable access to liquidity, which serves as a cheap source of funding for small-business loans. Alternative lenders are challenged by limited access to funding, often relying on third-party funding sources. This may prove problematic if and when the economy slows. To combat this and gain access to liquidity, alternative lenders are more frequently seeking bank charters or partnerships with financial institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While collaboration between FinTech companies and banks is largely hailed as a good thing, it recently came to light that </span><a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/large-banks-make-terrible-partners-fintechs-say"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech companies find it incredibly difficult to work with large, tier-one banks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Complaints include claims that banks string these companies along, fail to communicate, and often do not pay in a timely fashion. Some FinTech companies even reported that large banks have stolen intellectual property. Such issues could prove beneficial for community banks as alternative lenders may move downstream and choose to partner with smaller, community financial institutions. Community banks can partner with alternative lenders in a way that complements the bank’s current business model. This could include investing in alternative lenders or buying loans originated on an alternative lender’s platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a starting point, community banks should begin to think about ways to revamp their small business lending processes and make the customer experience a priority. Alternative lending, despite the previously mentioned weaknesses, has grown popular in recent years, largely due to its more convenient customer experience. Rather than taking several hours to complete that three-inch thick loan application, applying for a loan through an alternative lender can take mere minutes and be accomplished online or via mobile. Moreover, the approval time takes hours or days, not months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community banks can mirror alternative lenders’ lending processes by using technology to support online loan applications and power the underwriting and servicing of loans. This enables banks to significantly streamline the small-business loan application process and thus minimize the amount of information that applicants must supply. Banks can modernize the underwriting process by leveraging electronic data sources, including real-time business payment history, along with other technologies such as business intelligence and analytics. These support faster decisioning times and stronger risk mitigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As interest rates rise, community banks should identify ways to automate lending processes and fully leverage digital technologies to meet their customers’ heightened expectations for a better application experience and faster turnaround times. Community banks must also recognize and leverage their strengths, including their strong ties to local communities and access to liquidity and performance data that will help them better capitalize on small-business lending opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative lenders may have an advantage in some areas. Community banks would be wise to learn from these lenders and identify how to close the gaps in their own traditionally cumbersome and rigid lending processes. Doing so will enable community banks to meet market expectations for convenience and speed, positioning themselves for future loan growth and increased profitability.</span></p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-biometrics-market-is-expected-to-reach-a-value-of-30-bn-by-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">biometrics market is expected to experience a substantial growth over the coming years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some </span><a href="http://www.acuity-mi.com/GBMR_Report.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggest that by 2020, global mobile biometric market revenues will reach $34.6 billion annually. Mobile technology is believed to become a major force in accelerating the adoption of biometrics. More than 800 million biometrically enabled transactions will be completed annually on mobile devices by 2020, generating nearly $7 billion in annual biometric authentication revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To embrace the opportunity and meet ever-increasing consumer expectations from online and offline experiences, Visa makes biometrics the centerpiece of the future of payments. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biometrics centerpiece of Visa's new security roadmap</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa shared its new </span><a href="https://www.visa.com.au/pay-with-visa/security/future-of-security-roadmap.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">security roadmap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, focusing initially on biometrics, with Joe Cunningham, Head of Risk for Asia Pacific at Visa, touting the technology as having an important place in the future of payments.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Cunningham said biometrics are now at a point where Visa and its ecosystem of banks, merchants, FinTech firms, service providers, law enforcement, and cardholders feel comfortable supporting it, as he said certain forms of biometrics have reached a stable and secure level.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">"We always expected biometrics to get to a point where they would play an important role in payments, in fact, we expected biometrics to play an important role in our lives as we go about our day-to-day business whether it's accessing buildings, our car, or an online service," he said. "So there's no surprise that payments have been front and center when it comes to biometric adoption. Everyone thinks of biometrics when they think about payments in the future."</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">In addition to biometrics being the immediate focus of Visa, its 2017 priorities also include educating the ecosystem on 3D Secure version 2.0, and to speed up the use of tokenization.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">"The vision over the long term for security is to completely eliminate all sensitive data from the ecosystem," Cunningham said.</span></li>
