          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p>Bank and credit union data is incredibly useful and almost everyone in the industry needs it. You can find potential customers, leverage it for investment banking, competitive analysis, due diligence, and monitoring the health of the industry. Finding financial institution (FI) data seems pretty straightforward – a good amount is publicly reported. However, once you start digging, you will find that it’s not that easy. The dominant provider of this data is SNL Finance, which was acquired by S&amp;P Global for $2.23 billion in 2015.</p>

              <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singapore's FinTech is on the way to global leadership</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/singapores-fintech-industry-global-leadership/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singapore</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the gems of the global financial services industry ecosystem with ~200 banks with total assets of $2 trillion having operational headquarters in the city. Global financial institutions like </span><a href="http://newsroom.mastercard.com/press-releases/mastercard-to-launch-singapore-innovation-rd-center/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mastercard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.ubs.com/magazines/innovation/en/about-us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UBS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/dbs-invests-7-1-million-to-build-a-silicon-valley-in-singapore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DBS Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/ocbc-bank-launches-fintech-innovation-lab-in-singapore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OCBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://thefinlab.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UOB,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/citiforcities/home_articles/n_singapore.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citigroup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have already launched their </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/88-international-startup-accelerators-incubators-innovation-labs-nurturing-innovators-in-financial-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">innovation labs and accelerators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Singapore along with significant investments in the ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singapore has one of the most forward-thinking governing authorities in the financial services industry internationally. To support the development of a vibrant FinTech ecosystem (there are </span><a href="http://directory.singaporefintech.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">400+ FinTech Startups</span> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">incorporated in Singapore), MAS has taken steps to ensure Singapore’s leading position as a leading global FinTech hub: those include </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/singapore-fintech-festival-fintech-hubs-flight-to-the-top/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">committing S$225 million under the Financial Sector Technology &amp; Innovation (FSTI) scheme;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the launch of the FinTech and Innovation Group (FTIG) and the FinTech Office; creation of a </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/international-fintech-regulatory-sandboxes-launched-by-forward-thinking-financial-authorities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech regulatory sandbox;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a move towards an open-API architecture; the “Singapore Payment Roadmap,” and the opening of the MAS’ FinTech innovation lab – the “Looking Glass @ MAS,” amongst other first-of-their-kind initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only does Singapore offer the most fertile ground for innovators to launch and test their solutions, </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/singapore-is-shaping-up-to-become-the-blockchain-center-of-the-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the country is also paving its way into becoming the blockchain center of the world</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the end of October, </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sopnendu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sopnendu Mohanty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Chief FinTech Officer of MAS, announced that </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/26/singapore-cryptocurrency-blockchain-trial.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singapore will conclude its experiment with blockchain technology and its own digital currency in 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before deciding whether to commercialize the trial. In 2016, MAS announced </span><a href="http://www.mas.gov.sg/Singapore-Financial-Centre/Smart-Financial-Centre/Project-Ubin.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Project Ubin,"</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an exploration of DLT. Now, the MAS trial is looking at delivering securities, cross-border payments and, finally, using a digital version of the Singapore dollar to carry out real </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">transactions and buy assets. Several major banks – including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Credit Suisse – are involved in the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-magic-of-open-apis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open APIs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not just a concept for financial institutions in Singapore. A number of banks have embraced this wonderful opportunity, and OCBC Bank is one of the leaders in this field via its </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/leading-api-bandwagon-apac-connect2ocbc-story/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connect2OCBC platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – an open API platform – and the vast set of transactional APIs that was released for the external developer community. Connect2OCBC was launched in May 2016, an initiative that made OCBC Bank become the first bank in Southeast Asia to launch an open API platform. This platform enables external developers and FinTech players to collaborate with OCBC Bank as an innovation partner. It also helps them to develop unique applications that will add value to OCBC’s customers. This essentially is a clarion call to the creative technological talent available in the market to join forces with OCBC Bank and take a step towards digital, open banking. The efforts made by the Singapore government to cultivate a “Smart Nation,” along with a regulatory environment that encourages innovation, have helped OCBC Bank plug into the “open data economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the launch, OCBC has received more than </span><a href="http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/banking-finance/dbs-launches-worlds-largest-banking-api-developer-platform"><span style="font-weight: 400;">150,000 APIs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calls or requests across all its APIs. The bank was also the first in Singapore to launch a transactional API for GIRO, setup in September 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another major institution – </span><a href="http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/banking-finance/dbs-launches-worlds-largest-banking-api-developer-platform"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DBS – launched the world's largest banking API developer platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the beginning of November, boasting of 50+ successful collaborations. All in all, DBS has launched 155 APIs for Singapore across more than 20 categories; more categories will be added in response to demand.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-gledhill-52142036/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Gledhill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, DBS Group CIO, </span><a href="http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/banking-finance/dbs-launches-worlds-largest-banking-api-developer-platform"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> "DBS embarked on a journey to transform our tech infrastructure nine years ago. With that early start, we are now ahead of many others in being digital to the core. This has given us an edge – enabling us to operate with FinTech-like ability and nimbleness, and also platform-like inclusiveness."</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singapore FinTech Festival 2017 – FinTech Hub's Flight to the Top </span></h2>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>SecurionPay extends services to forex and partners with XTB</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X-Trade Brokers Brokerage House, a world leader in FX and CFD trading publicly </span><a href="https://www.gpw.pl/company-factsheet?isin=PLXTRDM00011"><span style="font-weight: 400;">listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has teamed up with SecurionPay, a Swiss-based payment platform for global card payments processing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SecurionPay has quickly become a partner of choice for many European businesses within various industries and has now opened its platform to forex as well. XTB chose the Swiss platform as their payment partner for its versatile APIs and unique technological solutions that meet XTB’s fast-growing business needs and global presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more than 14 years of experience, XTB allows their clients to trade with confidence. With this strategic partnership, the brokerage house takes a leap forward in delivering its clients fast, secure and convenient payment possibilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been looking for a solution with top-notch technology that will make us stay out from the crowd and the partnership with SecurionPay neatly ties back to our vision of delivering a seamless user experience,” says Director of XTB International Michal Sobczyk. “We see SecurionPay as our strategic partner because of their technology that answer all our needs. As the leading brokerage house, we wanted to put in place innovative solutions and service excellence. SecurionPay has it all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under this agreement, SecurionPay with its unrivaled experience on the high-risk market will be delivering conversion-increasing payment solutions. The partnership combines the strengths of both companies to meet an ever-increasing demand for secure financial operations in this industry. As a result, a forex company can deliver uninterrupted payments to their customers and monitor each transaction in real time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re thrilled to formalize our partnership with XTB, sharing advanced technologies and complementary competencies. The integration of our systems enables our new partner to create a unique experience for all XTB clients. They will see a real difference,” says SecurionPay CEO Lucas Jankowiak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SecurionPay’s solution gives forex companies full control over the development process and their transactions. They can see all the payment details in real time, so they can react immediately if something unexpected occurs. All this with the most advanced security systems. The payment platform makes it easy to expand activities to other markets by allowing businesses to conduct operations in 160 currencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">X-Trade Brokers was also looking for a solution that adopts the security mindset. SecurionPay, with its potential to revolutionize the payments market, offers anti-fraud tools, non-invasive 3D Secure, built-in machine learning capabilities to detect fraud, and fraud patterns that mark charges as fraudulent or suspicious as soon as they are made. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We understand that there’s a huge number of transactions in (the) forex industry, so while meeting all PCI level 1 standards, we offer a technologically advanced solution that helps to minimize card fraud,” explains Jankowiak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The foreign exchange market is the largest and fast-growing sector with payment operations across borders. The value of transactions processed each day all over the globe is rising exponentially so the entire process needs to be as simple and secure as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By choosing SecurionPay, we could avoid mounds of paperwork to get started, so the onboarding process was at the speed we needed. Its breakthrough technology that truly mirrors the world in which we operate enables us to connect with customers faster. Since the partnership went live in July this year, we can see an impressive difference in credit and debit card acceptance,” says Sobczyk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SecurionPay enables its clients to combine various billing models and create payment scenarios that fit their needs as much as possible. A payment platform focuses mostly on the technology and user experience, so SecurionPay expands its solution to help partners hit those goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our technology allows XTB and other clients to process an infinite number of transactions. There are no delays, redirections or interruptions in payments, and everything can be done smoothly in seconds. We are expanding the solution with many features to give clients new paths for revenue development and help them grow at double-digit rates,” sums up Jankowiak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The collaboration is a step forward for both SecurionPay and XTB in the midst of companies aiming to bring continuous innovation to deliver the best-in-class trading experience and establish long-term relationships with clients.</span></p>
