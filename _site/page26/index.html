          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term ‘robo-advisor’ refers to online investment services that deliver algorithmically derived financial advice. Robo-advisors typically provide their clients with one or more of the following features: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Formulaic goal-based advice, </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Tax-smart software, </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Globally diversified asset allocation, and </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Index exchange-traded fund (ETF) portfolio construction. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commoditization of these features has made it nearly impossible for robo-advisors to differentiate themselves from their competitors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Predictably, robo-advisors have begun a race to zero, as lower fees are the only differentiator readily understood by the majority of clients. The winners of this race will be the ‘Big Four’ major fund companies – Vanguard, Charles Schwab, Blackrock, and Fidelity. Their scale, brand recognition, and ownership of funds will allow them to waive management fees, cross-sell services, and reduce fund fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To compete with the ‘Big Four,’ pure-play robo-advisors will need to transition from mechanical goal-based advice to holistic personalized financial planning, and more importantly, shift from index ETFs to proprietary investment solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The evolutionary path for the second generation of pure-play robo-advisors (further referred to as robo-advisors) will require the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) as well as a renewed focus on asset management. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">R</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obo-advisors’ incorporation of machine learning will allow them to develop holistic and client specific financial plans in a cost-efficient manner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, pure-play robo-advisors have a technological advantage over the ‘Big Four’ and will likely be the first to bring comprehensive AI to the FinTech space. API integration coupled with AI has the unparalleled ability to aggregate and analyze a client’s digital profile. This aggregation will include real-time data from the client’s banking, brokerage, lifestyle, and work-related digital platforms. The benefit of this aggregation is that it forces AI to continuously analyze documented long-term behavior. Analysis of observed behavior can lead to predictive insights into the client’s upcoming life events, volatility tolerance, cash needs, spending habits, and life expectancy. The end-result of this analysis will be a dynamic financial plan and personalized, behaviorally derived advice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the head start in AI technology currently enjoyed by robo-advisors, the software will ultimately become a commodity. The true long-term differentiator for robo-advisors lies not within their technology capabilities, but rather their investment solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although robo-advisors need to continue to enhance their technology, it is imperative that they offer proprietary investment solutions that are superior to those of the ‘Big Four.’ Asset allocation among the Big Four’s ETFs, even if done well, will likely not lead to substantial differences in performance due to similar allocation methods and fee structures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To overcome this dilemma, robo-advisors will need to design proprietary investment products. Furthermore, these products will, on average, need to outperform their benchmark. Two robo-advisors that have historically outperformed are</span><a href="http://www.polarisportfolios.com"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Polaris Portfolios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.qplum.co/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">QPlum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survival and growth of robo-advisors is directly dependent on their ability to cost-effectively produce quality investment vehicles. The vertical integration of differentiated investment products will give robo-advisors the ability to keep and gain market share in the FinTech space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the success of automated investment services – particularly when it comes to pure-play robo-advisors – will not be determined by the implementation of the AI technology, but by the only thing that should matter in wealth management: long-term performance. Such performance will require a commitment to the development of proprietary, alpha-generating products. Let the race begin!</span></p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of July 2017, WhatsApp counted 1.3 billion active monthly users. To put things into perspective, imagine that the whole population of India or China is active on WhatsApp every month. WhatsApp is a well-known heavyweight in mobile communications, and now, the Facebook-owned social app is armed and ready to storm one of the most important FinTech markets in the world – India. All local players (possibly </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/31/remitly-is-raising-up-to-115m-led-by-naspers-payu-to-double-down-on-remittances-in-india/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remitly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, PayU, </span><a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/how-phonepe-plans-to-beat-paytm-in-the-payments-game-with-this-pos-calculator-2424735.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PhonePe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Paytm) are entering a whole new level of competition with this announcement. Fascinating times ahead!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">WhatsApp in-chat payments feature is bad news for digital wallets, payment companies in India</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Instant messenger WhatsApp is readying an intuitive in-chat payments feature, ahead of a likely December launch in India, that promises to make customer onboarding a cinch. It could be the biggest threat that players in the Indian digital payments ecosystem have faced to date.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">This will be the first time that WhatsApp is introducing the payments feature anywhere in the world.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">WhatsApp partnered with the State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, and HDFC Bank – three of India’s biggest banks – to launch the feature. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The uniqueness of the WhatsApp payments feature is that a user can make payments without leaving the chat interface just like sharing a contact or location on the instant messenger.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">WhatsApp’s entry into the space threatens digital wallet companies as the instant messenger counts over 200 million users in India, the largest user base it has in the world.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Consulting firm Zinnov estimates that nearly 2 million women sell products using WhatsApp and Facebook, totaling sales of $8-9 billion. This is projected to grow to $48-60 billion by 2022.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange moving into banking intensifies the competition in the already-very-competitive banking and tech space. Moreover, telcos are the ones to impose the most interesting challenge as they hold the keys to connectivity. Telcos have always played an extremely important, highly integrated role in users' lives – everything is tied to a telco, making communication companies critical stakeholders in anything that has to do with providing online/mobile services. Will Orange redefine the landscape and invite other telcos to join the competition? </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exclusive – Orange is the new bank? Telecom giant ventures into lending</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Telecom giant Orange launches its own bank on Thursday, aiming to win 25% of France’s online banking market by capitalizing on the rising use of smartphones to steal shares from established lenders with inferior technology.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The launch has two goals: 1. Push to find alternative revenue streams and retain clients in the face of a price war in the telecommunications sector; 2. Test for the telecoms and banking industry, marking the first attempt in a major developed market by a telecoms company to launch a standalone bank.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">About 25,000 customers have expressed interest ahead of the launch. The company has 21 million mobile clients.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Orange has beefed up financial services across its networks over the past 10 years under several brands, such as Orange Money, Orange Cash, and Orange Finanse in Poland, which uses a platform created by Polish lender mBank.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Orange targets 400 million euros in revenues for its financial services unit by 2018, out of which half would come from Africa.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“Our ambition is to offer everything. We are a complete bank,” said Andre Coisne, Chief Executive of Orange Bank.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">From November 2, Orange customers can use an instant mobile payment service as well as a free debit card, current account and savings account. Its online app will also allow users to transfer money via text message to another Orange account, and use Apple or Android wallets.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Other products, such as loans and insurance, are expected next year. </span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a tribute to what </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/?s=amazon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we at LTP have been talking about for some time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, FIs have started realizing that </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/understand-future-of-financial-services-industry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTechs are not that big of a challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to their top line and bottom line, but </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/epic-lesson-banks-can-learn-from-amazon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may very well be.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks Need to Fear Amazon’s Finance Ambitions, McKinsey Says</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The industry needs to continue its digital makeover to protect the up to 40% of revenues at risk by 2025 and prepare for competition from so-called platform companies like Bezos’ Amazon.com, Inc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“We thought that FinTechs would provide the chief digital threat,” authors of the report said. Instead, it’s become clear that e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. “are reshaping one industry after another, blurring sector boundaries as they seek to be all things to all people.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon has a small-business lending arm that has doled out more than </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-08/amazon-s-lending-business-for-online-merchants-gains-momentum"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to more than 20,000 of the merchants on its e-commerce platform.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Banks need to defend their turf. Payments will become the battleground where finance will be fought over the next 15 years.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Tech companies will reorder global commerce into ecosystems in which giants provide a variety of products and services through a single gateway. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Banks will still have opportunities in this new order because they are trusted by customers and hold vast data sets about retail and corporate transactions. The global banking industry could offset the loss of profits from price competition by partnering with platform companies and generating more revenue from their data. Banks that go further by creating their own platforms could elevate their ROE. </span></li>

          <a href="/banking/fintech/insights/2017/11/01/why-the-bank-of-the-future-is-not-a-bank/" class="post-link"><h3 class="h1 post-title">Running Scared – Why the Bank of the Future Is Not a Bank</h3></a>
          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 10 years from now, are we going to look back and realize that banks had already missed the massive market change and were already on their way out?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, I have been having a number of conversations with friends and clients (all experts) about digital transformation and banks built for the future. On more than a few occasions, we’ve stared down the rabbit hole of tactical topics like building the best product development shop, becoming a better acquisition target or attracting millennial depositors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In every case, they had lost the narrative about banking and I’ve had to reset the conversation. We had to get back to the first principles – a topic worthy of its own discussion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In resetting these conversations, the following four posits are good starting points I’ve used:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posit 1: Banking Products Not From Banks</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A variety of people have written at length about the rise and success of organizations like </span><a href="https://rocket.quickenloans.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rocket Mortgage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.sofi.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoFi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and others. Many banks partner with FinTechs for ancillary products and services in lieu of being able to build and deploy them internally. This limits growth and introduces a variety of alternative competitors not burdened by traditional banking mores and norms. It is now significantly more likely that we get banking products from non-banks.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posit 2: Bank’s Changing Customer Landscape</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone are the days of &lt;20 transactions per month oriented around the branch. I had 209 transactions in September and not a single one involved a check or a branch. The last time I went into a branch was to close an account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve gone from mobile-first to mobile-only in a remarkably short amount of time. That trend is expanding and extending across the financial services landscape.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posit 3: Dissatisfaction Drift</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you look at the wave of dissatisfactions roiling around the world, a massive one comes out of banking. While the 2008 financial crisis might seem far away to those in the industry, it had a massive – and lasting – impact on the average person. Not since the great depression, I think, do people speak of banks in as negative a way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also consider drops in mortgages, the glut in car loans, and the dominant role consumer payments have begun to play via touchless payment platforms and peer-to-peer payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add to that a massive increase in competition in traditional FinServ markets, like financial advisors vis-a-vis robo-advisors, with price wars and subsequent drops in customer satisfaction. In the political spectrum, these waves brought Chavez, Duterte, Trump, and Sanders to the forefront; in the banking space, it has opened a massive wedge for organizations like </span><a href="https://squareup.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Square</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (and their new charter) and others to ride the wave.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posit 4: The Wildcards of AI &amp; Blockchain</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having spent over 25 years in and around AI, I know it will not cure all the world's ills; and it certainly will not be a panacea to solve banking challenges for anyone – be they a banker, a consumer, a regulator or a banking solution provider. AI is just one category of algorithms that can be wielded – sometimes well, oftentimes not well – as part of large problems being solved.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/an-overview-of-blockchain-technology/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is evolving in much the same way enterprise data storage has evolved – except, in this case, we are not going to witness a 20-year evolution, but a 5-year one. At the end of it, we will be able to store and share information just a bit more securely than we do today. Blockchain is the realization that information alone, without context &amp; isolated, has almost no value. Blockchain will fulfill the dreams, desires, and promises of all of those who promised that databases will solve your problem in the ‘80s and ‘90s, how the cloud would solve all your problems in the 2000s, and how Big Data would solve all the woes of the last decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both cases, try to ignore the hype machine.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get Back to First Principles</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grab a cup of coffee, turn off your phone, and write these four posits down on a piece of paper (yes, paper). Now, just think about the future for an hour. Get back to first principles:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">If you’re a bank, focus on running the best bank at the lowest expense with the highest customer satisfaction you can. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">If you are a consumer, understand all your options, do some research, and pick &amp; choose your solutions thoughtfully. </span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what I’ve been thinking about: I was having a conversation with a friend (formerly of a big bank) and we were discussing common themes amongst a certain category of banks – how their financials just looked bleak: not enough deposits, costs were too high, and new products were hard </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expensive. We broke down the common solution banks use to solve these problems – consultants to renegotiate core contracts, FinTech partners sticking their head in the sand. We hypothesized the </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-modular-bank-of-the-future/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘bank of the future’</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when all core services would be outsourced – from the core bank, to all banking products, to regulatory compliance. A core business operation and marketing/sales organization would be the only non-outsourced functions. We concluded that in 10 years, this kind of completely outsourced bank </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will be</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‘best in the class bank.’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I shuddered imaging being in the boardroom of any competing bank then, or now. </span></p>
