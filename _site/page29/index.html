              <p>Amazon is nothing short of a modern business wonder – the company is aggressively entering industries with no limit in sight. Amazon started off selling books out of Bezos’ garage and is now the largest online retailer in the world of everything from electronics to groceries. The company is in cloud computing; shipping and logistics; and on and on.</p>

              <p>October is <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/national-cyber-security-awareness-month">Cybersecurity Awareness Month</a>, and with the recent string of data breaches, protecting assets in an increasingly digital world is at the top of many consumers’ minds. While you’ve probably heard about the importance of enabling <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/10/15946642/two-factor-authentication-online-security-mess">two-factor authentication</a> (2FA) on your accounts (you might even be familiar with some common modes of <a href="https://www.payfone.com/">2FA</a> like those SMS codes your bank texts you, or 2FA apps that you need to download), did you know that there is an even easier and safer authentication method that works through your mobile phone? Called mobile identity authentication, this technology allows your phone to act as an ultra-secure way to protect yourself against cyber-fraud without having to type in a password, download an app, or fumble with annoying text passcodes. Intrigued? We were too, which is why we caught up with Rodger Desai, cybersecurity expert &amp; CEO of mobile identity authentication company <a href="http://www.payfone.com/">Payfone</a>, to learn more about how mobile identity authentication works and why so many enterprises, like the top US banks and healthcare organizations, are abandoning traditional authentication methods in favor of this more secure next-generation tech.</p>
