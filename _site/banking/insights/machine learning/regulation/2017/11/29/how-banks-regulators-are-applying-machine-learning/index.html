Among institutions that are applying machine learning are BBVA, JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, OCBC, and many more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Credit applications and underwriting are the </span><a href="https://igniteoutsourcing.com/publications/machine-learning-in-finance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">key areas where machine learning, and data analytics in general, will have an initial impact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

The banks have achieved these gains by devising new recommendation engines for clients in retailing and in small and medium-sized companies. They have also built micro-targeted models that more accurately forecast who will cancel service or default on their loans, and how best to intervene, the consultancy says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let's explore some interesting examples of machine learning applications in banking.</span></p>

<td style="width: 165px;"><b>BBVA</b></td>
<td style="width: 581px;">Cristóbal Sepúlveda, Technical Architect at BBVA, exposed an actual use case of this technology: “At BBVA, we developed a service recommendation engine for bank users. With this proposal, what we are trying to do is offer the best commercial offer depending on the most used transactions by the user and their navigation patterns.<br />
All this information is processed in a classification algorithm which then generates a recommendation. “The volume of information is incredibly vast and the only way to offer a recommendation is using machine learning technologies,” he noted.

<td style="width: 165px;"><b>JPMorgan Chase</b></td>
<td style="width: 581px;">At JPMorgan Chase, a learning machine is parsing financial deals that once kept legal teams busy for thousands of hours. The program, called COIN (Contract Intelligence), does the job of interpreting commercial-loan agreements that, until the project went<br />
online in June 2016, consumed 360,000 hours of work each year by lawyers and loan officers. The software reviews documents in seconds, is less error-prone and never asks for vacation. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Made possible by investments in machine learning and a new private cloud network, COIN is just the start for JPMorgan Chase. The firm set up technology hubs for teams specializing in big data, robotics and cloud infrastructure to find new sources of revenue while reducing expenses and risks. The system already is helping the bank automate some coding activities and making its 20,000 developers more productive, saving money.<br />
When needed, the firm can also tap into outside cloud services from Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-28/jpmorgan-marshals-an-army-of-developers-to-automate-high-finance">Read more here. </a> </span></td>

<td style="width: 165px;"><b>HSBC</b></td>
<td style="width: 581px;">The CIO at HSBC Darryl West said the bank is using machine learning to run "analytics over this huge dataset with great compute capability to identify patterns in the data to bring out what looks like nefarious activity within our customer base. The patterns that<br />
we identify are then escalated to the agencies and we work with them to track down the bad guys." The bank said earlier this year that it is using Google Cloud machine learning capabilities for AML. <a href="https://www.computerworlduk.com/galleries/data/how-uk-banks-are-looking-embrace-ai-machine-learning-3657529/">Read more here. </a></td>

<td style="width: 165px;"><b>OCBC</b></td>
<td style="width: 581px;">The Singapore-based OCBC Bank has unveiled plans to use artificial intelligence and machine learning as part of its efforts to reduce financial crimes. The bank intends to deploy these technologies to deal with the increasing scale and complexity of AML<br />
monitoring, in addition to increasing the bank’s operational efficiency and accuracy in the detection of suspicious transactions.<br />
OCBC Bank has conducted a PoC with ThetaRay. Now, the company plans to start an extended PoC and a pre-implementation phase. The algorithm will detect anomalies in transactional behavior by evaluating broad parameters such as products, customers, and risks, instead of looking at each transaction as a standalone. In the PoC stage, the technology was deployed to analyze one year’s worth of OCBC Bank’s corporate banking transaction data. The findings demonstrated that it decreased the number of alerts, which did not require further review, by 35%. <a href="http://riskmanagement.banking-business-review.com/news/ocbc-bank-to-use-ai-and-machine-learning-to-combat-financial-crimes-091117-5967954">Read more here. </a></td>

<td style="width: 581px;">Lloyds Banking Group has partnered with AI startup Pindrop to use its machine learning technology to detect fraudulent phone calls. Pindrop can identify 147 different features of a voice from a phone call or even a Skype call, which can help a person identify<br />
information such as the location that a caller is in creating an "audio fingerprint". Lloyds Banking Group will introduce the software across the Lloyds Bank, Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands. Lloyds said the partnership with Pindrop will help it cut down call times as well as protect customers. "The reason for us doing it is about saving money from fraud," said Martin Dodd, Group Telephone Managing Director at Lloyds Banking Group. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/11/lloyds-uses-google-backed-ai-to-detect-phone-fraudsters.html">Read more here. </a></td>

and something called regular expressions, which is a way to machine-identify structured phrases in text-based documents. In one of our first tests, we examined corporate issuer filings to determine whether we could have foreseen some of the risks posed by<br />
the rise and use of credit default swaps [CDS] contracts leading up to the financial crisis. We did this by using text analytic methods to machine-measure the frequency with which these contracts were mentioned in filings by corporate issuers. We then examined the<br />
trends across time and across corporate issuers to learn whether any signal of impending risk emerged that could have been used as an early warning." Until today, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bauguess-big-data-ai">SEC<br />

<td style="width: 581px;">The bank has been working on a project dubbed "AppBank." The initiative seeks to use machine learning. AppBank is run by a new business unit, which includes data scientists and machine learning professionals. Its goal is to increase "large-scale automation" and<br />
while it is particularly focused on operations technology, it will tackle applications across every business unit at the firm. "The goal is to be able to provide more insight into the health and operations of the systems. We think of it as our 'check engine light' product," said Don Duet, head of technology at GS. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a light on a car dashboard coming on to indicate a problem, the software would inform users when there was something that could prevent the bank's technology infrastructure from running smoothly. <a href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/goldman-sachs-head-of-tech-machine-learning-20160330">Read more here. </a>. Being one of the most forward-thinking institutions, Goldman Sachs has strong ties (as a customer and as an investor) with AI software provider <a href="http://www.digitalreasoning.com/">Digital Reasoning </a>,<br />
whose solution GS <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2016/11/07/wall-streets-big-brother-the-startup-goldman-sachs-and-steve-cohen-are-using-to-track-traders/#4138c6e3b13e">uses to track traders </a>. The same startup has also launched a program<br />
with NASDAQ to use its AI technology to track trading data, communications, emails, chats and even voice data to ferret out misconduct across the entire electronic stock exchange. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/the-robots-are-coming-for-wall-street.html?_r=0">Goldman Sachs also uses the machine learning platform Kensho to mine data<br />
from the National Bureau of Labor Statistics </a> and compile all that information into regular summaries. The reports feature 13 exhibits predicting stock performances based on similar employment changes in the past, and they’re ready to print just nine minutes after the data is entered. </span></td>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Western Independent Bankers (WIB) </span><a href="http://www.wib.org/WEB/Online/Library/Digests/Technology___Security_Digest/2017_Tech/March17-Tech/tech-march17_brown.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that banks and FinTech companies already use machine learning to detect fraud by flagging unusual transactions. Such anomalies are investigated, with the result being fed back into the system so it can learn and thus further build the customer profile. The process is far more efficient than human manual monitoring and is expected to become the norm in banking and finance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"While previous financial fraud detection systems depended heavily on complex and robust sets of rules, modern fraud detection goes beyond following a checklist of risk factors – it actively learns and calibrates to new potential (or real) security threats. This is the place of machine learning in finance for fraud – but the same principles hold true for other data security problems. Using machine learning, systems can detect unique activities or behaviors (“anomalies”) and flag them for security teams. The challenge for these systems is to avoid false-positives – situations where “risks” are flagged that were never risks in the first place," <em>Tech Emergence </em></span><a href="https://www.techemergence.com/machine-learning-in-finance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emphasizes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
