              <p>High connectivity is one of the hallmarks of the modern society. At any moment in time, individuals are plugged into society through the range of devices, which as well are constituting a complex ecosystem of smart connected things. According to <a href="http://harvardecon.org/?p=3310">HBR</a>, “Consumers are becoming more and more connected whether it is at home, at work, behind the wheel, when they engage in sports and leisure activities, and so on. This is happening quite fast, due to the adoption of smart devices, and companies have to be able to react accordingly in order to maximize value both for their clients and for themselves.”</p>

              <p>Given that <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/mobile-white-paper-c11-520862.html">three-fourths (75%) of the world’s mobile data traffic will be video by 2020</a>, there is a strong chance that the future of payments will migrate from buttons in apps and mobile-friendly web pages into video-embedded options. In this <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/mobile-white-paper-c11-520862.html">study</a>, Cisco explains that mobile video will grow at a CAGR of 62% between 2015 and 2020, higher than the overall average mobile traffic CAGR of 53%. Of the 30.6 exabytes per month crossing the mobile network by 2020, Cisco estimates that 23.0 exabytes will be due to video. Mobile video represented more than half of global mobile data traffic beginning in 2012, indicating that it is already affecting traffic today, not just in the future.</p>
