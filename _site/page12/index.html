          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese e-commerce colossus Tencent is an elephant in the room that is impossible not to talk about as the company </span><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/21/investing/tencent-facebook-value/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surpasses Facebook in value</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after a blockbuster year that saw its share price more than double. Tencent makes headlines on many accounts, including foreign high-caliber investments – earlier this year, it picked up a </span><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/08/technology/snap-tencent-snapchat/index.html?iid=EL"><span style="font-weight: 400;">12%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stake in Snap (the owner of Snapchat) and </span><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/29/technology/tencent-tesla-pony-ma-elon-musk/index.html?iid=EL"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in electric vehicle giant Tesla, aside from series of investments in startups across Asia. Investments, however, are not what I'd like to drill into this time.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tencent's WeChat and its scale</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tencent is probably best known for its mobile messenger WeChat (less for Tencent QQ, which was released in 1999 – 12 years earlier than WeChat), and rightfully so. </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradstone6/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brad Stone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luluchenyilun/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lulu Chen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Bloomberg, share that </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-06-28/tencent-rules-china-the-problem-is-the-rest-of-the-world"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than two-thirds of Chinese people use Tencent's two messaging apps, WeChat and QQ</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for everything from texting to shopping, flirting, dating, watching videos, playing games, and ordering food and taxis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Mary Meeker's 2017 Internet Trends report reveals that </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/wechat-captures-about-30-percent-of-chinas-mobile-app-usage-meeker-report.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">~900 million hours a day out of a total of ~3.1 billion hours of mobile app usage took place in WeChat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Collectively, Chinese users spend 1.7 billion hours a day on Tencent apps, which is more than they spend on all other apps combined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Released in 2011, WeChat now has close to 938 million active users, more than a third of whom spend in excess of four hours a day on the service, with half of the users spending </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tencent-wechat-china/with-new-mini-apps-wechat-seeks-even-more-china-clicks-idUSKCN18E38Z"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&gt;90 minutes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a day on the app. To put that in context, Stone and Chen share that the average person around the world spends a little more than an hour a day on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter combined.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How WeChat uses AI</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only are Tencent and its offsprings massive communications and commerce vehicles in China, but also, the company is making strides to leave Western competitors in the dust with its AI integrations.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28555" src="/uploads/2017/11/wechat1.png" alt="Why WeChat is the Swiss Army Knife of the Chinese Digital World" width="1502" height="908" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source: </span></i><a href="http://ai.weixin.qq.com/#application"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat AI</span></i></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fcbgc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edward Bell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the CEO of FCB (Foote, Cone &amp; Belding) Greater China, describes some of </span><a href="https://www.warc.com/NewsAndOpinion/Opinion/2289"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the ways AI is used in WeChat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voice recognition is one of the biggest areas of everyday AI in action in WeChat. The company behind the technology is called </span><a href="https://www.chumenwenwen.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chumen Wenwen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (</span><a href="https://www.mobvoi.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobvoi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in En). The concept works in a similar way to Apple's Siri but with a built-in app that responds with more words and particularity in answers. The service links directly with third-party apps, enabling users to use voice to perform necessary actions in those apps.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">WeChat's virtual girlfriend app Xiaobing, which was developed by Microsoft and has an icon to type with, can have a conversation with the user. Users can even play 'guess who I am' game with her.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Translation capability – Translating Chinese is an extremely tricky task because Chinese data is all double-byte. WeChat allows to open up the translation account and paste or type in what needs to be translated, whether English or Chinese. Seconds later, the AI provides the answer, including alternative translations in case users don't agree with the AI's recommendation. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The Voice Donor – an initiative to have thousands of books voice-recorded for the blind. QR codes were put in the blank pages of books and the reader was invited to read a passage. The AI then intelligently edited all the passages together and 200,000 people's voices were put to use.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While all of it is impressive, one feature that I thought is just wonderfully brilliant is that apparently WeChat's 'shake your phone feature' is used to connect strangers who are shaking their phones at the same time. I don't know if anyone offers an easier way to connect digitally without having to memorize names to look them up later or having to type in names in different apps to find a person (that's if you can type names right in the first attempt). </span></p>
<p><a href="https://qz.com/974408/tencents-wechat-gives-it-an-advantage-in-the-global-artificial-intelligence-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat is perfectly positioned to get the AI game right</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (especially with its recent push into research via </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/27/tencent-ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Being a chat app, WeChat is able to collect countless messages each day that real people send to one another. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Conversational data is richer [than search or shopping data] because you have that many people on the platform performing that many interactions,” </span><a href="https://qz.com/974408/tencents-wechat-gives-it-an-advantage-in-the-global-artificial-intelligence-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tak Lo, Partner at Hong Kong-based AI startup accelerator </span><a href="https://www.zeroth.ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zeroth.ai</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Shopping and search engine data show one type of data, which is purchasing or shopping intent, which is valuable, but different. For example, if you were to build out a Natural Language Understanding engine, you would not use search engine data, because no one searches based on complete conversational phrases.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://qz.com/974408/tencents-wechat-gives-it-an-advantage-in-the-global-artificial-intelligence-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">QZ</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes that WeChat has an extra advantage: a significant portion of its users communicate using voice. Push-to-talk, a neglected feature in most countries, </span><a href="https://qz.com/443441/stop-texting-right-now-and-learn-from-the-chinese-theres-a-better-way-to-message/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has become a preferred method of chat for many users on WeChat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That means Tencent can draw not just from text but from recorded speech too by turning devices into walkie-talkies.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat as a business-driving vehicle</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While single-purpose apps in the US are struggling to gain traction partially because of exactly that – being </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/contextual-commerce-from-single-purpose-apps-to-all-in-one-platforms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">single-purpose</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Tencent made its apps a lifestyle choice by jamming multitude of use cases into a single platform. WeChat already serves as a one-stop-shop for everything from reading news and booking taxis to ordering takeaways and making payments. In fact, among the </span><a href="https://chinachannel.co/1017-wechat-report-users/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top reasons users are joining a WeChat group of 100+ users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is everything an average Western user does across separate proprietary solutions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Corporate internal communications </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Professional networking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Leisure and life (e.g. school colleagues)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Information sharing (e.g. online courses)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Entertainment-oriented (e.g. fan groups)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of groups – WeChat groups are very powerful marketing vehicles for e-retailers, whom the company doesn't even charge commissions or transaction fees. Especially popular and useful groups can bring money to their creators through membership fees (much like Instagram stars would collect ad money, but WeChat group owners can charge for membership in their groups).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat has a whole suite of </span><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/wiki?t=resource/res_main&amp;id=mp1496561283_bc5Rt"><span style="font-weight: 400;">instruments and instructions for official account platform developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which even includes WeChat Invoice, an e-invoicing capability. WeChat has released an electronic receipt General Solution Program to promote the usage and convenience of electronic receipts with the focus on users at the center, the company shares. WeChat has designed an ‘authorize first, swipe later’ billing and payments process in view of the different amounts of time that different vendors will need to issue a receipt. It decouples the two processes of the user's submission of a request and their receiving of the receipt. The receipt is guaranteed to make it to the user's account in a stable and reliable manner when the user is fully aware of what is going on.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat Pay</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat Pay is one of the cornerstones of WeChat's extensive capabilities. Used in China by 600 million people, the service takes advantage of Chinese banks’ low processing fees, allowing users to send very small monetary gifts called “Red Packets” to each other – a feature WeChat introduced in 2014 to exchange money electronically, based on the age-old Chinese custom of giving red envelopes filled with money at weddings, holidays, and special occasions, journalist </span><a href="https://evelinechao.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eveline Chao</span></a> <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3065255/china-wechat-tencent-red-envelopes-and-social-money"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. WeChat allows its users to send Packets of predetermined amounts to each other, either individually or in groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chao </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3065255/china-wechat-tencent-red-envelopes-and-social-money"><span style="font-weight: 400;">describes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the obsession with this digitally revived tradition the following way: "Say you have a chat group with five pals. You can put $5 in a red envelope and set it to disburse equally, so each friend gets $1. Alternatively, you could stipulate that the first two people to tap will get all the money in equal portions – $2.50 each – or that the first two people get a random cut, maybe $1 for one person and $4 for the other. The result is that any time a red envelope appears, people scramble to tap on it as fast as possible. (The packets expire in a day, adding to the time pressure.) Only afterward do they see how much money they’ve won, giving it an addictive element of surprise. So addictive, in fact, that third-party apps now exist that let users grab red envelopes without unlocking their phones."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The journalist also shares that in the last Chinese New Year, &gt;420 million WeChat users sent a total of 32 billion red envelopes (10X increase from 2015). More impressively, </span><a href="http://www.scmp.com/tech/article/1913340/wechat-red-envelopes-help-drive-online-payments-use-china"><span style="font-weight: 400;">409,000 of them were sent in a single second</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, just after midnight on the first night of the holiday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other, more generic, </span><a href="https://chinachannel.co/1017-wechat-report-users/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">situations of WeChat Pay use</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Supermarket and convenience stores – 28.9%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Online shopping – 26%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Restaurants and food – 21.6%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Malls – 20%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Utility fees – 14.2%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Transportation and travel – 13.2%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Entertainment and leisure – 8%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Public departments – 4.3%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Beauty and fitness salons – 4.2%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Hospitals – 2.8%</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/GrgoireTHIEBAULT/wechat-bible-for-brands-v1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">functionality of the super app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is nothing short of impressive. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat mini-programs and developer tools </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat also operates its own developer platform with </span><a href="https://chinachannel.co/1017-wechat-report-users/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">200,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> third-party developers that are making everything imaginable and unimaginable to keep users glued to the platform. WeChat even offers </span><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/wiki?t=resource/res_main&amp;id=mp1455784134"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeUI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – is a set of basic style library consistent with WeChat native visual experience, officially designed by the WeChat Design Team, tailor-made for WeChat Web development and WeChat mini-programs, in order to improve and standardize the experience for WeChat users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat rivals Google and Apple developer platforms with its WeChat JS-SDK – </span><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/loginpage?t=wxm2-login&amp;lang=zh_CN"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat public platform </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with WeChat in-app based web development toolkits for web developers. Through using WeChat JS-SDK, web developers can effectively use the capabilities of mobile phone systems to take pictures, select pictures, voices, and locations. Also to use WeChat's unique capabilities such as WeChat sharing, scanning, card, payment to provide WeChat users better quality Web experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would be pointless to list dozens of extensive capabilities WeChat enables, they can be found with clear instructions in </span><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/wiki?t=resource/res_main&amp;id=mp1445241432"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat Official Account Platform Documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why the Swiss Army knife?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In tier one Chinese cities (the most developed cities like Beijing, Shanghai etc.), WeChat’s penetration rate is around 93%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"To get an understanding of the current capabilities of WeChat, and why it is so popular in China, imagine WhatsApp combined with Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Skype, Tinder, eBay, PayPal, Uber, Google Maps, Slack, Apple Pay and many more apps used by western consumers. WeChat allows users to do everything from communicating with friends, staying up to date with the news or celebrities, booking doctors’ appointments, hailing a ride or paying bills. All of this is done without ever having to leave the app. &lt;...&gt; </span><b>For companies that are looking to the Chinese market, no matter who your customer is, they’re on WeChat. All of your Chinese competitors... They’re on WeChat too. Not being on WeChat places you a step behind in the increasingly competitive Chinese market.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">" – </span><a href="http://maicapital.com/news/wechat-explained"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAI Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an Australian Investment Group focused on investing in companies looking to expand into China.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annual worldwide AI revenue is projected to grow from $644 million in 2016 to </span><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160825006052/en/Artificial-Intelligence-Revenue-Reach-36.8-Billion-Worldwide"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$37 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 2025, with </span><a href="https://www.top500.org/news/market-for-artificial-intelligence-projected-to-hit-36-billion-by-2025/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top use cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> including algorithmic trading strategy performance improvement; static image recognition, classification, and tagging; efficient, scalable processing of patient data; predictive maintenance; content distribution on social media; and much more. </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/how-banks-regulators-are-applying-machine-learning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning is extensively applied by financial institutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/ai-most-defining-technology-banking-industry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI is becoming the most defining technology in banking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Furthermore, AI is expected to have a strong impact on the FinTech community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With data being the primary force behind AI advancement, international corporations in the years ahead will be competing for the dominance in this segment. Meanwhile, the startup community will be a major beneficiary as tech giants are </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/democratization-of-advanced-technologies-building-ai-that-can-build-ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">democratizing AI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How AI Is Changing FinTech</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investment in FinTech organizations rose by approximately 10% to just over $23 billion in 2016 alone. Here are some ways in which AI is playing a major part in changing FinTech:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Increasing security: Because AI helps by analyzing larger volumes of security data and is also able to scale to the size of a company as it grows, this technology can aid organizations in identifying: fraudulent behavior; suspicious transactions; potential future attacks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Reducing processing times</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Reducing duplicate expenses and human error</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Increasing levels of automation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Offering game-changing insights</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Empowering smaller companies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Balancing consumer budgets based on spending patterns</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Chatbots in financial services are: driving more seamless shopping; taking orders directly from social media channels; editing and checking bank account details; supervising consumer credit score; informing consumers of upcoming payments; and helping consumers to create realistic budgets.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial Intelligence is Transforming Sales In Surprising Ways</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Too much of a salesperson’s daily activity is spent on tedious and monotonous tasks like cold calling, prospecting, responding to email, etc. Meanwhile, 40% of time spent on sales-related activities can be automated by adapting current technologies with AI. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">By embedding AI into CRM databases, salesforce automation software, help desk solutions, and other B2B apps, a lot of the crippling rote tasks still performed by salespeople can be eliminated. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The effects include decreased cognitive load, increased job satisfaction, and stronger overall rapport and relationships across the sales organization.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">AI helps salespeople increase lead quantity as well as quality. Companies using AI for sales were able to increase leads by 50%. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">AI has the potential to transform salespeople into marketers’ most trusted advisors by doing the ‘heavy lifting and determining which leads represent the best targets for inbound and outbound marketing initiatives. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">AI enables salespeople to more effectively engage with customers. Prescriptive AI solutions deliver much more than predictive scores. They provide insight into why one prospect is more lucrative than another. This insight enables sales to create more personalized content, and engage in more targeted outreach.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baidu and Xiaomi are working together on Internet-of-Things and artificial intelligence</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Baidu and Xiaomi have announced a strategic partnership to tackle two emerging technologies: IoT and AI.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The two firms said will immediately explore opportunities in voice recognition, deep learning, and computer vision, in addition to more work with DuerOS. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Further to that, Baidu’s tech reach also extends into robotics, AR, VR and self-driving cars, which could also be areas of joint cooperation in the future for Xiaomi.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Baidu has favored a partnership based approach with hardware makers to get DuerOS and other technology into the hands of consumers. The company doesn’t charge a license fee for the OS – the same applies to this Xiaomi deal – and it claims to work with 130 companies that cover smartphones, smart TVs, smartwatches and home appliances.</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banking</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barclays is building a retail bank in the US</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Barclaycard in the US is building a digital bank and will rebrand itself as Barclays next year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The credit card issuer, a division of British bank Barclays, has been targeting prime and super-prime borrowers with an online personal loan it has been quietly offering on a test-and-learn basis to a small group of customers since last November. It plans to launch that offering publicly by the middle of 2018. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">This year, the company also began testing a personal financial management tool in its credit card app called My Personal Bank, which aggregates customers’ Barclays’ credit cards, personal loans and savings products – as well as accounts with other banks – into a single place. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Barclaycard is morphing its business into a more complete suite of digital banking offerings at a time when FinTech startups and online banking products are starting to look more and more similar. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Chase introduced Finn this year, an app for people who would rather skip the branches for completely mobile checking and savings accounts with personal finance tools; and Wells Fargo announced a similar offering called Greenhouse, a standalone mobile banking app with digital-only accounts and personal finance features.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Barclaycard launched in the US in 2004 as one of the earliest digital-only banks, though it only offered savings accounts and CDs. Today, it’s the ninth largest US card issuer, with $26 billion in card loans and $12 billion in online deposits.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Internet Has Altered the Meaning of “Truth” and “Trust”</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Tech companies will enter a new era of accountability. The idea that the likes of Uber, Facebook, and Amazon are immune to regulation, tax, and compliance, that they’re just these disruptive pathways that connect people and resources, I think those days are over.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financial services industry is no stranger to machine learning – a number of large institutions continue to successfully implement the technology across such </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2016/06/04/machine-learning-is-redefining-the-enterprise-in-2016/#2a65c5b01871"><span style="font-weight: 400;">areas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as risk analytics and regulation, customer segmentation, cross-selling and upselling, sales and marketing campaign management, creditworthiness evaluation. Among institutions that are applying machine learning are BBVA, JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, OCBC, and many more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Credit applications and underwriting are the </span><a href="https://igniteoutsourcing.com/publications/machine-learning-in-finance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">key areas where machine learning, and data analytics in general, will have an initial impact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The outcomes will include cost reductions, increased efficiency, and less onerous customer experiences," experts </span><a href="http://www.barclaysimpson.us/news/machine-learning-the-next-frontier-for-financial-risk-management--news-801817925"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suggest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. McKinsey </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/an-executives-guide-to-machine-learning"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that in Europe, more than a dozen banks have replaced older statistical-modeling approaches with machine-learning techniques and, in some cases, experienced 10% increases in sales of new products, 20% savings in capital expenditures, 20% increases in cash collections, and 20 percent declines in churn. The banks have achieved these gains by devising new recommendation engines for clients in retailing and in small and medium-sized companies. They have also built micro-targeted models that more accurately forecast who will cancel service or default on their loans, and how best to intervene, the consultancy says.</span></p>

<td style="width: 581px;">Cristóbal Sepúlveda, Technical Architect at BBVA, exposed an actual use case of this technology: “At BBVA, we developed a service recommendation engine for bank users. With this proposal, what we are trying to do is offer the best commercial offer depending on the most used transactions by the user and their navigation patterns.<br />
All this information is processed in a classification algorithm which then generates a recommendation. “The volume of information is incredibly vast and the only way to offer a recommendation is using machine learning technologies,” he noted.

<td style="width: 165px;"><b>JPMorgan Chase</b></td>
<td style="width: 581px;">At JPMorgan Chase, a learning machine is parsing financial deals that once kept legal teams busy for thousands of hours. The program, called COIN (Contract Intelligence), does the job of interpreting commercial-loan agreements that, until the project went<br />
online in June 2016, consumed 360,000 hours of work each year by lawyers and loan officers. The software reviews documents in seconds, is less error-prone and never asks for vacation. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Made possible by investments in machine learning and a new private cloud network, COIN is just the start for JPMorgan Chase. The firm set up technology hubs for teams specializing in big data, robotics and cloud infrastructure to find new sources of revenue while reducing expenses and risks. The system already is helping the bank automate some coding activities and making its 20,000 developers more productive, saving money.<br />
When needed, the firm can also tap into outside cloud services from Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-28/jpmorgan-marshals-an-army-of-developers-to-automate-high-finance">Read more here. </a> </span></td>

monitoring, in addition to increasing the bank’s operational efficiency and accuracy in the detection of suspicious transactions.<br />
OCBC Bank has conducted a PoC with ThetaRay. Now, the company plans to start an extended PoC and a pre-implementation phase. The algorithm will detect anomalies in transactional behavior by evaluating broad parameters such as products, customers, and risks, instead of looking at each transaction as a standalone. In the PoC stage, the technology was deployed to analyze one year’s worth of OCBC Bank’s corporate banking transaction data. The findings demonstrated that it decreased the number of alerts, which did not require further review, by 35%. <a href="http://riskmanagement.banking-business-review.com/news/ocbc-bank-to-use-ai-and-machine-learning-to-combat-financial-crimes-091117-5967954">Read more here. </a></td>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Western Independent Bankers (WIB) </span><a href="http://www.wib.org/WEB/Online/Library/Digests/Technology___Security_Digest/2017_Tech/March17-Tech/tech-march17_brown.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that banks and FinTech companies already use machine learning to detect fraud by flagging unusual transactions. Such anomalies are investigated, with the result being fed back into the system so it can learn and thus further build the customer profile. The process is far more efficient than human manual monitoring and is expected to become the norm in banking and finance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"While previous financial fraud detection systems depended heavily on complex and robust sets of rules, modern fraud detection goes beyond following a checklist of risk factors – it actively learns and calibrates to new potential (or real) security threats. This is the place of machine learning in finance for fraud – but the same principles hold true for other data security problems. Using machine learning, systems can detect unique activities or behaviors (“anomalies”) and flag them for security teams. The challenge for these systems is to avoid false-positives – situations where “risks” are flagged that were never risks in the first place," <em>Tech Emergence </em></span><a href="https://www.techemergence.com/machine-learning-in-finance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emphasizes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right partnerships will define success stories across industries. The insurance and financial services industries are the ones to benefit the most as it becomes clear that technology companies can bring efficiency into processes and redefine business models.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">InsurTech Is Hitting Critical Mass</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched in 2013, Chinese non-life insurer ZhongAn has already reached a market cap of $13.6 billion on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where it started trading in late September this year. ZhongAn uses artificial intelligence and big data to generate mass market sales over the internet. Its flagship product is a policy that covers the cost of returning products bought on shopping platform Taobao.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ZhongAn has sold over 7 billion policies to 490 million customers so far. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">InsurTech startups represent 15% of the $50 billion invested in the global FinTech arena during the 2010-15 period.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the insurance products have become commoditized, driving prices and margins down. For example, 70% of people renewing their car insurance policy in the UK use price-comparison sites. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaborative win-win opportunities in the upstream part of the supply chain are possible for insurers and startups alike. For example, Shift Technology provides AI solutions for insurance fraud detection and automated claims management. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promising segments for market growth/disruption include mobile POS (e.g. inexpensive insurance for shipping return, flight delay, cracked phone screen), group healthcare and automated claims management. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional insurers quick to leverage the relevant startup services while defining a digital vision for themselves might be able to thrive.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Machine Learning Truly Applies To Digital Identity</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two broad categories of ML models are clustering (unsupervised learning) and classification (supervised learning). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clustering is the grouping of similar data into groups, where data in the same group is more closely related to each other than to data in other groups. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classification is the process of identifying which label a new observation belongs to, knowing the classification of observations from a fact-based training data set. This method can be used to generate a predictive model to associate multiple advertising identifiers to one consumer or a household. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most effective digital identity solution comes from utilizing a hybrid of these two models. Semi-supervised learning leverages advantages from both clustering and classification algorithms to achieve higher accuracy. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In semi-supervised learning, a small amount of labeled data is used along with unlabeled data as the training data set for the model. With this approach, the quality, freshness and statistical relevance of the labeled data can be managed. Another advantage of utilizing this model is to perform household identification using classification techniques with labeled data across household devices and then clustering these household devices into individual groups with significantly smaller labeled data sets.</span></li>
