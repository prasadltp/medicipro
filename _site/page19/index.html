          <a href="/crowdfunding/fintech/insights/payments/2017/11/14/paypal-explores-crowdfunding-launches-money-pools/" class="post-link"><h3 class="h1 post-title">Daily Review: PayPal Explores Crowdfunding, Launches Money Pools</h3></a>
          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its latest move, PayPal explores another line of business – crowdfunding – with a competitive edge for its current customers. While renowned platforms collect fees from campaigns, PayPal offers the service for free (for now and for its account holders only), locking its account holders inside the PayPal ecosystem while locking the competition out. PayPal is not the first large FinTech to get its hands into the two hottest segments – payments and lending (think </span><a href="https://squareup.com/townsquare/square-capital-now-offers-flexible-loans-to-boost-lending"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Square Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). After all, why bother with a cacophony of financial products when </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/global-fintech-funding-36-bn-2016/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two types of offers are steadily the most represented and most funded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayPal launches Money Pools, where groups chip in to raise money to buy things</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayPal launches </span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/money-pools"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money Pools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a service that lets people create pages to let their contacts fundraise for a specific item or event, such as buying a group gift, a group trip, or housemates paying the rent.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">PayPal is launching the service in 16 countries – Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States. Anyone who has a PayPal account in these regions can create a Money Pool, or contribute to one. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“Unlike crowdfunding solutions, Money Pools are not intended to facilitate fundraising for activities such as product development and organizers agree not to offer perks, rewards, or other incentives in return for contributions made to a Money Pool.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The service is free when you use money from your PayPal wallet, or a debit card or a bank account linked to your PayPal account. </span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/gb/selfhelp/article/faq690"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standard PayPal fees apply</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when you have to make a currency conversion or use a credit card (also linked to your PayPal account). For comparison, </span><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/paypal-launches-p2p-funding-platform-2017-11?IR=T"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GoFundMe and Kickstarter each take a 5% cut of the money raised on their sites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and GoFundMe also charges a 2.9% credit card processing fee plus 30 cents per donation.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Once you create a page, Money Pools works similarly to other social funding sites like GoFundMe: you can personalize the page with pictures and how you want contributions to appear (public or anonymously); you can update the site’s activity feed; and you can – important for social-payments – share a link to the campaign with a short URL.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colossal SoftBank fund could shake up tech world</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Japan-based SoftBank's The Vision Fund's $100 billion nearly equals the total amount pumped into venture capital-backed companies in 2016.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The huge amount of cash could accelerate the trend where fast-growing startups remain private – without the scrutiny and transparency of a stock market debut.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">SoftBank has outlined plans to focus on late-stage investments when startups are more established, (and on investments of at least $100 million).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The SoftBank fund is widely expected to pump some $10 billion into ride-sharing giant Uber, which has a whopping valuation near $70 billion. Such a deal would boost the profile of the Japanese group in Silicon Valley.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">SoftBank's early, lucrative investment in Alibaba was part of a strategy focused on booming e-commerce in China, according to GGV Capital managing partner Hans Tung.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">SoftBank's recent investments in ride-sharing firms in various countries fit a pattern of seeking money-making synergies by bringing competitors together to share technology, learnings, and more. "Masayoshi Son understands the value of consolidation," said Tung. "It is affecting the way society moves from less efficient to more efficient, and the amount of innovation that could happen. If consolidation is somewhat expedited with SoftBank money, that is not necessarily a bad thing."</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Targets for the Vision Fund were expected to include e-commerce, ride-sharing, robotics, and machine learning.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">SoftBank has shown a preference for technology trends with the potential to spread across borders and have a significant impact on society, according to those who have tracked the company.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">And with all the data collected by ride-sharing, e-commerce and other platforms, investing in artificial intelligence to mine insights from mountains of information makes sense.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Insurance Sector Adopting Blockchain to Protect Data</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">A total of 14 European insurance providers have partnered together with Deloitte and other firms to provide a simple system for insurers to comply with the Hamon Law, with requires insurers to provide simple transfers for clients who wish to change companies during the first year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system will allow for highly secure information storage for customer data. The newest regulations from the EU, called </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-blockchain-can-help-solve-global-regulatory-challenges-analysis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will take effect in 2018, and could impose massive fines on companies that aren’t particularly protective of consumer data. </span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The platform relies on Proof of Process technology in order to secure user data through a shared data repository. </span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Open-Source Blockchain Projects Are Abandoned Within Six Months</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Just 8% of the 26,000 open-source blockchain projects created back in 2016 are still around today.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The average lifespan of an open-source blockchain project is just one year.

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><b>Ravi Menon’s Remarks at Singapore FinTech Festival</b><b><br />
</b><b>Singapore Expo – November 14, 2017</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to the second edition of the Singapore FinTech Festival:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> •  This is the largest gathering of the global FinTech community anywhere in the world.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  We have more than 25,000 participants from across 100 countries.</span></p>
<h6><b>“The Future Is Already Here”</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world is becoming more digital, especially here in Asia.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  According to Bain &amp; Company, in the past year alone, the number of online-engaged consumers in Southeast Asia has surged by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">50% </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to 200 million people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And FinTech – or the application of technology to financial services – has been at the forefront of this digital renaissance.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  According to Ernst &amp; Young, FinTech has already achieved initial mass adoption and is now poised for mainstream adoption.<br />
</span>•  About 1 in 3 digitally active users globally already consider themselves regular users of FinTech services. In China, that figure is nearly 70%.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singapore’s FinTech journey is set against this emerging digital future.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  It is also part of Singapore’s broader Smart Nation agenda, to harness the power of technology to support better living, increase productivity, and create new jobs.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  A smart nation needs a smart financial center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globally, the financial industry is facing slower economic growth, tighter regulation, and keener competition. It needs to foster innovation and transform itself.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  This means harnessing technology</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><b>- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">to increase efficiency, manage risks better, create new opportunities, and improve people’s lives</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  If Singapore is to maintain its position as one of the top financial centers in the world, it must embrace FinTech – maximizing its benefits, minimizing its risks.</span></p>
<h4><strong>STRATEGIES FOR A SMART FINANCIAL CENTRE</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, for the last two to three years, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has been working together with the industry to foster a thriving FinTech hub. This requires getting several pieces right:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  an ecosystem of diverse players competing and collaborating;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  an open architecture economy that enables connectivity and innovation;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  a web of international links to promote the exchange of ideas and scale solutions;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  a strong talent pool and deep research capabilities;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  a conducive regulatory environment; and<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  a safe and secure cyber environment.</span></p>
<h6><b>Ecosystem of Diverse Players</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to create an ecosystem for innovation, where established financial institutions and FinTech startups compete as well as collaborate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial institutions are no longer the laggards and technology dinosaurs of popular myth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know this from my conversations with CEOs of global banks and insurance companies.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Almost every major financial institution has an active innovation agenda to strengthen its business by harnessing technology.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Many CEOs today can carry on an intelligent conversation about blockchain without looking at their notes – this is a big change from just two years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singapore wants to be the place where these financial institutions test, develop, and apply new technology solutions.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> •  Just in the last few years, global MNCs have set up more than 30 FinTech innovation labs or research centers in Singapore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FinTech startup space has become a lot more vibrant.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  More than 400 FinTech enterprises have set up base in Singapore.<br />
</span>•  We have startups experimenting with new ways to pay, save, invest, buy insurance, and plan for retirement.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No innovation ecosystem is complete without physical spaces to facilitate experimentation and collaboration.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Last year, we saw the launch of LATTICE80, Singapore’s first FinTech innovation village, occupying two whole floors of 80 Robinson Road.<br />
</span><i>•   </i><b><i>Well, the entire building at 80 Robinson Road will now become a FinTech innovation hub.<br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  It will be named 80RR – that’s 100,000 square feet dedicated to housing FinTechs, right in the heart of the financial district!</span></p>
<h6><b>Open Architecture</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A smart nation needs an “open API economy.” APIs are the “connectors” that allow systems to talk to one another, enabling service providers to harness information from multiple sources and produce holistic solutions for customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAS has been encouraging financial institutions to develop and share their APIs openly so that they can work with other service providers to give customers a richer and more seamless experience. We started the ball rolling last year.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  With the Finance-as-a-Service API Playbook, banks have a common guide to identify and develop APIs.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  And with the Financial Industry API Register, FinTech startups have a one-stop shop to explore the open APIs that have been made available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are pleased to see more banks in Singapore opening up their APIs, with tangible benefits to consumers.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  OCBC Bank has 43 open APIs on its platform that are actively been tapped on by FinTech players, and even government authorities such as the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  DBS Bank has launched the world’s largest banking API developer platform with more than 170 APIs and over 50 successful collaborations.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers looking for properties on the PropertyGuru platform can instantly find out if they are eligible for a property loan and even apply for the loan online.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  UOB has also recently put in place its regional open banking API platform.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> Customers can submit and read restaurant reviews, place reservations, and pay for their food, all within UOB’s mobile app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, over 270 open APIs have been made available by the Singapore financial industry.</span></p>
<h6><b>Network of International Links</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of this week, MAS will have signed 16 FinTech cooperation agreements with governments and authorities around the world.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  These agreements facilitate information sharing on FinTech trends and regulatory issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abu Dhabi, Australia, Denmark, France, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Poland, South Korea, Switzerland, Thailand and the United Kingdom, as well as the Association of Supervisors of Banks of the Americas.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  They also have a referral mechanism that supports Singapore FinTech startups in overseas markets, and facilitate overseas startups to set up in Singapore as a gateway to Asia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Some of our co-operation agreements also include joint innovation projects. Let me give a tangible example:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Singapore and Thailand have each developed their own systems for making payments from one bank account to another – in real-time, 24/7.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  We call our system PayNow; Thailand calls theirs PromptPay.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  </span><b>MAS and the Bank of Thailand have agreed to work together to link PayNow and PromptPay.<br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  The aim is to enable someone in Singapore to send money to someone in Thailand, and vice versa, using just their mobile phone numbers – instantly, securely, and at any time of the day.</span></p>
<h6><b>Talent and Research</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To sustain our FinTech efforts, we need a strong pipeline of talent and research capabilities.</span></p>
<p><b>We are pleased to announce that MAS and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have agreed to enter an R&amp;D collaboration in FinTech</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  This will enable our local FinTech talents to work alongside world-class researchers at the MIT Media Lab to come up with technology solutions to real-world use cases.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  They will run pilots using distributed ledger technology, cryptography, quantum computing and big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One area where we want to make a concerted effort is data analytics and artificial intelligence.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>•  MAS is launching a S$27 million Artificial Intelligence &amp; Data Analytics Grant. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is part of the S$225 million Financial Sector Technology &amp; Innovation Scheme.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  The new grant will support the adoption and integration of AI and data analytics in financial institutions.<br />
</span>•  Just as important, it will be used to help professionals in the financial sector to up-skill and adapt to the use of these new technologies.</p>
<h6><b>Conducive Regulation</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most critical pieces that we must get right is regulation.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  How can we make regulation conducive to FinTech innovation, while still ensuring that the system remains stable, key players are sound, and consumer interests are safeguarded?<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  This requires a keen understanding of emerging technologies and new business models, and being alert to potential risks while taking care not to stifle innovation.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Easier said than done! Let me give a few examples of how MAS has tried to strike the right balance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take for example virtual currencies, or commonly known as cryptocurrencies. MAS does not regulate virtual currencies; in fact, we welcome them as an innovation that can potentially reduce the cost of financial transactions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we regulate the activities that surround virtual currencies if these activities pose specific risks.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  First, virtual currency transactions could potentially be exploited for money laundering or terrorist financing due to the anonymous nature of the transactions.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> And so, intermediaries in virtual currency services will be subject to anti-money laundering requirements.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Second, virtual currencies can go beyond being a means of payment to representing ownership of assets, as we see in many Initial Coin Offerings or ICOs. This makes them look very much like a share or bond certificate.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> So, if the digital token is structured like a security, then the ICO must meet the requirements of the Securities and Futures Act. This is to protect investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech developments are forcing regulators to review the way regulation is done.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  If FinTech is unbundling the financial services value chain, then regulators may have to “unbundle” their regulations too.<br />
</span>•  I suspect, increasingly, we will have to take a <i>more risk-specific </i>approach and an <i>activity-based </i>approach with respect to FinTech. This means:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> Setting thresholds for when regulation kicks in;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> calibrating regulatory requirements to specific risks; and<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> applying these requirements to activities rather than entities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good example of our attempt to do this is the new Payment Services Bill, which we will publish for public consultation next week.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Our aim is to right-size the regulations, to fit the various new developments that are taking place in electronic payments.<br />
•  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Licensees will be regulated according to the activities they conduct because different activities pose different risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, there are areas – be it new technologies or new business models – where regulators will never know enough. This is where the regulatory sandbox comes in – to facilitate experimentation in a contained environment.</span></p>
<h6><b>Cybersecurity</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, cybersecurity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we go more digital and online, cyber-risks will mount. And if these risks are not managed well, public trust and confidence in technology will suffer.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  To fully harness the benefits of digital technology, we must build robust cyber-defenses and have effective remediation plans when things go wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, cyber-surveillance and information sharing. </span><b><i>We are pleased to see the official launch in Singapore of the Asia-Pacific Regional Information &amp; Analysis Centre by FS-ISAC</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  FS-ISAC, or the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Centre, is a global intelligence gathering and sharing initiative for the financial sector, with over 7000 members worldwide.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  The new center in Singapore will facilitate the sharing of cyberthreat information in a timely manner, and enable a rapid and coordinated response to emerging threats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, </span><b><i>MAS is reviewing its Technology Risk Management Guidelines</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We do this regularly, but this time we are doing it differently.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  For the first time, MAS is partnering the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) to co-create the guidelines.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  We will develop cyber risk management guidance </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the industry, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third, penetration testing. MAS already requires key financial institutions to conduct penetration testing of their cyber-defenses by independent third-parties. We need to go further.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  </span><b>MAS is partnering ABS to establish guidelines for “red-teaming,” to enhance cybersecurity testing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Red-teaming is a covert penetration test conducted on a financial institution’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">live </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">environment – its people, processes and technology – to assess their ability to respond to infiltration attempts.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  It will complement other forms of testing and assessments that are already in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I cannot emphasize enough how mission-critical cybersecurity is to the FinTech agenda.</span></p>
<h4><b>SOME POTENTIALLY TRANSFORMATIONAL FINTECH INITIATIVES</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have described our strategies. Let me now highlight five specific FinTech projects in Singapore that could potentially prove transformative in solving real-world problems.</span></p>
<h6><b>Enhancing Customer On-Boarding: KYC Utility</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, solving the “know-your-customer” (KYC) problem. KYC is one of the biggest pain points in the financial industry.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  It is an obligation in any customer on-boarding.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  But the process is costly, laborious, duplicative, and still not all that effective in detecting tax evasion or money laundering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government has taken the first step with MyInfo – a single platform containing personal data submitted to and verified by the government.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  MAS and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore have done a pilot with several banks to enable customers to open a bank account online using MyInfo.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  The pilot saw application timings shortened by as much as 80%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are now taking the next step. </span><b><i>MAS is working closely with local and foreign banks to explore a Banking KYC Shared-Services Utility that will streamline end-to-end KYC</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This means centralizing processes such as:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  leveraging on MyInfo for customer identification and verification;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  collecting and validating KYC documents; and<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  screening against sanctions and blacklists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Banking KYC Utility is potentially a transformative project.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  It will harmonize and enhance KYC checks across the industry.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  It will improve the quality of risk management while reducing cost and time taken.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  If all goes well, we hope to see the Utility in place next year.</span></p>
<h6><b>Making Trade Finance Safer and More Efficient: Global Trade Connectivity Network</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another area that could do with transformation is trade finance.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Today, it is largely paper-based. This is not only inefficient but increases risks such as fraud and duplicate invoicing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain technology offers good promise to make trade finance safer and more efficient.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Last year, DBS Bank and Standard Chartered Bank completed a proof-of-concept that demonstrated how blockchain technology could enable banks to detect if an invoice had already been financed.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Shortly after, HSBC and Bank of America did a proof-of-concept that showed how trade finance processes could be streamlined using blockchains and smart contracts.</span></p>
<p><b>Building on these, MAS and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will jointly develop the Global Trade Connectivity Network, a cross-border platform for trade finance using distributed ledger technology.</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  GTCN will be an open architecture platform that enables the seamless transfer of digital documents and data across borders, starting with the Singapore-Hong Kong trade corridor.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  If all goes well, we expect the GTCN to go live in early 2019.</span></p>
<p><b>Strengthening Supervision and Reducing Compliance Cost: SupTech</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not only the financial industry that needs FinTech but regulators as well.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  MAS has embarked on its own FinTech journey to make our supervision more effective and the compliance burden we impose less painful.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  We call it Supervisory Technology, or SupTech for short.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me give an example: detecting trade syndicates in the stock market.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  One of the most difficult things to detect in the market is collusive behavior and price manipulation.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  MAS has put in place a data analytics and pattern recognition system, to study trading behavior and detect accounts that may be:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> acting in concert to manipulate share prices, or<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> engaging in circular trading to create a false impression of market interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another example is that MAS is now working on a data analytics system to scour through the 3,000 “suspicious transaction reports,” or STRs, that financial institutions file each month on money laundering or terrorist financing risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major source of pain for financial institutions is regulators requesting for the same data more than once under different data collection exercises.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  We will fix this. </span><b>By taking a more cohesive approach to data, MAS will aim to achieve zero duplication in our data requests to financial institutions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  If we ask for the same data twice, the institution will be allowed to gently turn us down!<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  We will work with the industry on making this a reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And saving the best for the last: MAS will transform the way it collects data from financial institutions for supervisory purposes.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Today, financial institutions’ data submissions to MAS often involve manual processes to extract the information from their databases and fill up the MAS-provided form or template.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  And over at MAS, processing that data is also done manually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will make this more painless. </span><b><i>We have set a goal: all data requests from MAS will eventually be in machine-readable templates</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  The requested data will flow seamlessly from financial institutions’ databases to our forms and ultimately to the supervisory dashboards of MAS officers.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-</strong> No more “cut-and-paste.”</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  We will work with the industry on an implementation plan and a reasonable timeline.</span></p>
<h6><b>Making Cross-border Payments and Settlements Cheaper and Faster: Project Ubin</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, we must re-imagine a more efficient and secure way to conduct cross-border interbank payments and settlements.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Cross-border payments today rely on a correspondent banking network.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Banks hold balances with one another, and settlement occurs by adjusting these balances.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  There is counterparty risk, liquidity is split, and reconciliation is a major pain point.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Cross-border transactions often take days to settle, and at a high cost to customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the problem that Project Ubin seeks to solve using distributed ledger technology to enable entities across different jurisdictions to make payments directly to one another:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  without intermediaries;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  with much greater speed and efficiency, and<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  at lower cost and risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not an easy problem to solve, but we have made some progress.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Last year, Phase 1 demonstrated that banks could conduct inter-bank payments without going through MAS, using a blockchain-based digital representation of the Singapore Dollar.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Phase 2, just recently concluded, successfully produced three software prototypes that achieved decentralized netting of payments, in a manner that preserved transactional privacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAS has received keen interest in Project Ubin from many parties, including academia, and other central banks.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  We are committed to sharing what we have learned to encourage others to take a crack at solving this problem.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  We have just published the report on Phase 2.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  </span><b>More significantly, MAS will release publicly, free-of-charge, the source codes for all three successful prototypes from Project Ubin Phase 2.<br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Please take a look at the prototypes, study them, build upon them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s next? We are now preparing to extend Project Ubin beyond Singapore.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  </span><b>We are pleased to announce a collaboration on cross-border payments with the Bank of Canada using blockchain technology</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Deepening Financial Inclusion: ASEAN Financial Innovation Network</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we want to use FinTech to deepen financial inclusion across ASEAN.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  </span><b>MAS and the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation have teamed up to establish the ASEAN Financial Innovation Network (or “AFIN”)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  The goal of AFIN is to help banks and FinTechs in ASEAN collaborate, so as to broaden and deepen access to digital financial services across ASEAN.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AFIN is working on a cloud-based industry platform which will do three things:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  It will allow banks to search for and connect to innovative FinTech offerings.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  It will give FinTech firms an opportunity to scale up their business across borders.<br />
•  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will provide an industry sandbox to test out cross-border solutions. Regional regulators will be invited as observers of the sandbox.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of all, AFIN will provide a powerful platform to extend financial services to the millions of under-banked people in ASEAN.</span></p>
<h6><b>Conclusion</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singapore is on the FinTech journey because we want to make pervasive a culture of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">innovation </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in our financial sector. We must have:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  a restlessness to make things better,<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  a spirit of enterprise to try new ways,<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  a willingness to take manageable risks, and<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  the resilience to bounce back from failure to try again… and again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But FinTech must safeguard </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">trust </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">confidence</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Trust is the foundation for a market economy.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  In financial services and in the digital economy, it is absolutely critical.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Customers must have the confidence that systems are reliable, transactions are safe, their data are secure, and service offerings are in their best interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, everything we do in FinTech must have a larger </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">purpose</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ultimately, it must solve real-world problems, so that people’s lives are better off...</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  so that deserving small and medium enterprises can get financing to grow their businesses;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  so that migrant workers can send money back to their families cheaply, quickly, and securely;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  so that people can plan their finances holistically to meet their needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This room is filled with innovators, investors, business leaders, and policymakers from around the world.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Together, we can re-create finance with technology and innovation.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  As Tennyson puts it, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come, my friends, ‘tis not too late to seek a newer world."</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you!</span></p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><b>Singapore &amp; Bangalore, India </b><b>–</b><b> Nov 13, 2017</b><b> –</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Active.Ai, a Singapore-headquartered FinTech platform with an innovation lab in Bengaluru that delivers conversational banking through artificial intelligence (AI), announced a US $8.25 million Series A financing led by Vertex Ventures, Creditease Holdings, and Dream Incubator.

          <a href="/insights/regulation/2017/11/14/the-mother-of-all-regulators/" class="post-link"><h3 class="h1 post-title">The Mother of All Regulators</h3></a>
          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The utility for m-transactions will have to manage identity and provide relevant hooks for the movement of sensitive data amongst providers in the trusted ecosystem in real time and on a per-transaction basis. Effectively, one of the outcomes of such a utility will be the definition of a fair and sustainable business model, and separately, the basis for building a solution that can provide an appropriate level of customer support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the lack of a true cross-industry utility, and given the current environment of OEM-led fragmentation that is largely driving usability to suit its own interests, it is fairly obvious why we are struggling with both adoption and scale. The intelligentsia continues to be focused on relatively minor technology issues but there is no meaningful debate on how best we can collectively build this utility, only after which the next important step of building usability can commence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defining and eventually building this utility will not be a trivial undertaking. It is unlikely that such an undertaking – which will need so many different industries and regulators to come together – has been attempted before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as the utility needs cross-industry and regulatory cooperation, the usability will need a competitive marketplace. Solutions that offer true and sustainable value to the end-user will prevail, and those that do not will fade away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaboration across industry sectors possibly alongside like-minded regulators is best-suited for evolving the utility, its definition, or even better, a comprehensive specification with joint ownership that will ensure scale. Innovation and industry are best-suited to figure out usability – the solutions and their corresponding business models – that will drive adoption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some markets, individual providers may drive both utility and usability in a fragmented manner for its captive consumer base; and in other markets, the state may mandate the utility as well as usability solutions for its entire citizenry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The happy middle path that provides the right amount of innovation, choice, and protection to consumers, supported by a sustainable business model across the ecosystem of providers, will be left for each market to chart for itself based on its own socioeconomic considerations. The key will be to understand this distinction between utility and usability – its symbiotic relationship where one supports the other, and yet needs separate definition and sustenance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulators will need to be involved across the spectrum, providing much-needed oversight and enforcing compliance. Just like everything else, the key here will also be to ensure that they have the light touch that encourages innovators as well as the strong arm that repels violators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether numerous existing agencies come together as a single cohesive regulatory body, or a brand new regulatory regime evolves, the guiding principle for the-mother-of-all-regulators will be to define and deploy a cross-industry utility that will ensure scale, upon which a highly innovative usability environment can then help drive adoption, collectively addressing all the relevant technology, business and compliance issues related to seamless and secure personalized transactions.</span></p>
