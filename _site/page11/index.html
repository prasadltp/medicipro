              <ul>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em><b>The mobile payment service is now part of the Italian Public Administration’s electronic payment system</b></em></span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em><b>Paying taxes, fines and service fees by smartphone has never been so easy, fast and convenient</b></em></span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>#doitsmart</b></p>
<p><b>Milan, 27 November 2017 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span><b>Satispay</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the mobile payment app that is revolutionizing the electronic payments sector, has joined </span><b>PagoPA</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Italian Public Administration’s single payment system that enables citizens to pay for public services (taxes, fines, car taxes, health co-pays, etc.) quickly and easily, online, without having to queue at a branch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new agreement between PagoPA and Satispay is part of the broader </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three-Year Plan for ICT in Public Administration</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a document providing strategic and economic guidance on the digital transformation of the country’s PA. The plan’s main objectives include encouraging the adoption of enabling platforms such as SPID (digital identity), ANPR (national registry), and PagoPA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PagoPA, which has already been adopted by thousands of government offices, banks, post offices, credit institutions and businesses, allows citizens to pay for public services conveniently from home and provides various advantages, such as advance information about the cost of a transaction and receipts to document payments, which are booked in real time, making them immediately visible to payees. This flexible, modern system is intended to bridge Italy’s digital gap and make its public administration system more responsive to citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Satispay’s role in this process is to serve as an extremely simple, fast and convenient alternative method of payment: in 2017, the taxpayer’s charges for each transaction will be borne by Satispay, whereas from 2018, the fees will be just €0.20 for payments over €10 with no charge for smaller amounts. Yet, using Satispay to make payments provides much greater value, represented above all by the extreme speed and simplicity with which citizens can fulfill their obligations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To use Satispay to pay for public services, users simply select Satispay as their method of payment on the page where the total amount is calculated, confirm that they wish to pay with Satispay, and enter their mobile telephone number into the window that is displayed. Through the Satispay app installed on their smartphones (all brands and operating systems are supported), they will then immediately receive a notification, which they can accept in order to complete the payment in few seconds and receive an immediate receipt by email.</span></p>
<p><b>Alberto Dalmasso</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>CEO of Satispay</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, commented, “Satispay was founded with the precise goal of changing people’s daily payment habits, making their lives easier and generating savings, above all in terms of time. We have been working towards this goal with dedication and we have reached important agreements and milestones in the course of this year. Early on — when we were not yet in supermarkets or the stores of famous brands — the Italian government’s Digital Transformation Team recognized Satispay as one of the tools capable of contributing to the strategic project of digitalizing Italy. Over the past year, the opportunity to join PagoPA — a project central to the digital transformation of Italy — constantly stimulated us to do better and provide citizens with an efficient service that would profoundly simplify the way they manage their lives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Satispay app has been downloaded 380,000 times and the service has 220,000 active users to date. There are 21,000 businesses participating in the system, increasing by 80 each day. In Italy, more than 26,000 stores accept payments by Satispay.</span></p>
<p><b>Satispay </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Satispay is a mobile payment system that allows users to transfer money using an alternative network that does not rely on credit and debit cards. The service is efficient, free and secure. Available for download for iPhone, Android, and Windows Phone, Satispay can be used by anyone with a bank account. Sending money to phone contacts and paying in stores (online and physical) is as easy as sending a message or checking-in on social media. The service is entirely free of charge for users: there are no signup costs or charges for sending or receiving payments. There are no activation fees or monthly fees for physical and online businesses participating in the service, just a fixed fee of €0.20 for payments of more than €10: there are no fees at all for payments below this amount. Satispay S.p.A. is an innovative startup and a result of the hard work of a young Italian team. Following its previous financing rounds, the company recently completed a significant capital increase, bringing its total funding to €26.8 million. In addition to its clear economic advantages, Satispay also enables an improved customer experience by making payments faster and more efficient and reducing waiting times at the register. These are the reasons that are convincing small stores and large brands such as the following to add Satispay to their payment options: Esselunga, Coop, Trenord, Benetton, Caffè Vergnano, Venchi, Domino’s Pizza, Grom, MyChef, Gruppo Cigierre, Total Erg, Kasanova, Repsol, Freddy, Moleskine, Arcaplanet, MC2 St. Barth, Sorelle Ramonda, and Vivigas.</span></p>

          <a href="/fintech/insights/2017/12/01/how-fintech-company-and-national-postal-service-reach-unbanked/" class="post-link"><h3 class="h1 post-title">How a FinTech Company and a National Postal Service Reach the Unbanked</h3></a>
          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-October, FinTech firm </span><a href="https://conta.mobi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conta.MOBI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides payment account (including a free version), announced a collaboration with </span><a href="http://www2.correios.com.br/sistemas/rastreamento/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Correios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the state-owned company that operates the national postal service of Brazil. With this partnership, conta.MOBI enables its users to make deposits and withdrawals through the network of Correios, using the CPF as identification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The partnership provides conta.MOBI with a capability that no financial institution has, since Correios is an institution present in all cities of the country, with its own service and outsourced resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, the partnership includes only Correios' own agencies, but the intention of the companies is that the partnership extends to the whole network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Correios, conta.MOBI clients could already make withdrawals through the network of </span><a href="https://www.banco24horas.com.br/index/evento-banco24horas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banco24horas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ATMs, as well as perform transactions through a Visa prepaid card. Whoever opens a conta.MOBI account automatically receives the Visa virtual card and can apply for a physical one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a basic plan account and no monthly fee, the conta.MOBI's target audience are individual micro-entrepreneurs (known as MEI). The most expensive plan is BR$ 9.90 (~3 USD) monthly. Approximately 55% of the startup’s customer base today is MEI.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrepreneurs may have a POS system and charge through WhatsApp</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conta.MOBI was created in 2013 at Stanford University and started operating in 2014. Currently the company has a team of more than 50 employees. </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardocapucio-empreendedor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ricardo Capucio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CEO, explains that the account is called "payment account" and has many functions similar to the traditional bank account. It differs from checking account basically by not providing credit and for not receiving interbank credit transfers such as TED (Express Wire Transfer) or DOC (Credit Transfer Document), but only to transfer to other accounts. "The payment account is a more modern account, which allows you to receive without being tied to a bank," Capucio notes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefit for entrepreneurs is to have more possibilities of receiving payments: credit and debit through a payment link – which can be sent by social networks and WhatsApp, the most popular messaging app in the country; by ticket; by deposit made at the post office and also through the POS terminal that can also be integrated into the account. Each way of receiving has a specific fee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The partnership "is part of the strategy of replacing postal activity, which is declining worldwide. This possibility of adding products takes advantage of the reach of Correios, one of the oldest and dearest companies in the country," said Guilherme Campos, president of Correios. Campos said that the plan was presented by Ricardo, president of the account.MOBI last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the partnership of the conta.MOBI and Correios is available for the states of Minas Gerais and São Paulo, and according to Capucio, it must be available nationwide in January 2018.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Look for Big Tech – with caches of data about billions of people around the globe – to power the next jumps in financial technology, keeping users reined within their own, ever-expanding platforms and absorbing billions in profit that otherwise would have gone to traditional financiers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Amazon Lending has lent $3 billion to merchants since 2011. Google's venture arm is ramping up investments in cross-border currency transfers and Blockchain. China's tech giants have crashed onto American shores: cabs in New York and Las Vegas began accepting Alipay, Alibaba's mobile payment juggernaut.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Groundbreaking Blockchain service that runs on Azure could transform how companies raise money</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UK-based firm </span><a href="https://www.nivaura.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nivaura</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helped launch the world’s first automated bond issue in a cryptocurrency on a public Blockchain platform.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Nivaura has developed an Ethereum Blockchain-based service, which runs on the secure Microsoft cloud platform Azure, that reduces the need for middlemen and costs associated with regulatory clearances. As a result, it can help firms raise money at a much lower cost than current methods; and more investors can take part because it’s public.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Under the oversight of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the solution, which runs on the secure Microsoft cloud platform Azure, was recently used to enable online luxury retailer LuxDeco to issue ether-denominated bonds.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">In a world-first, Nivaura’s technology automated the creation of the necessary legal documents, the coordination of covenants, conditions, and book-building, the required e-signatures, the creation of the asset and money registers, delivery versus payment of the instrument and the ongoing management of the bonds, all on a public platform.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">JPMorgan, Allen &amp; Overy and Moody’s helped with Nivaura’s bond issue, which had a week-long maturity and paid 10% annual interest – a premium was added to manage volatility in the currency.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber inks its first mobile wallet deal in Southeast Asia</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Uber has inked its first payments deal in Southeast Asia after it announced a partnership with Vietnam-based mobile wallet service Momo.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Momo, which (raised $28 million led by Standard Chartered), will become a payment option inside the Uber app in Vietnam, alongside cash and credit cards. The app is the country’s top mobile payment service. It is used by 5 million people to pay bills, transport tickets and more.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The deal is the first of its kind for Uber in Southeast Asia, a region where it has a tough challenge battling Singapore-based Grab in seven markets and local unicorn Go-Jek in Indonesia.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Both Grab and Go-Jek have put a heavy focus on mobile payments, with each building a mobile wallet service of their own that will eventually go beyond paying for ride-sharing to pay for other goods. Go-Jek plans to spin out its Go-Pay service into a standalone app next year. Go-Jek may expand its reach outside of Indonesia using Go-Pay, rather than ride-sharing, as its initial launch service.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alibaba-Backed Paytm Aims to Become World's Largest Digital Bank</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Paytm Payments Bank aims to create the world’s largest digital bank with 500 million accounts, envisioning an online financial services provider of everything from wealth management to credit cards and stock market trading.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The bank is targeting people who don’t have access to professional financial services. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“We are unveiling our money market fund, launching our debit card and we’ll have the capabilities to allow enterprises to open business accounts,” Paytm Founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma said. “Digital payments was our entry point, we want to become a vertically-integrated financial services company.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Paytm was one of fewer than a dozen entities that secured permits to start payments banks, which can accept deposits and remittances but cannot lend.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The company will also operate a mobile-first bank with zero fees on online transactions and no minimum balance. Paytm Payments Bank is majority-owned by Sharma. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“We will launch share trading and insurance products very soon,” Sharma added. “We want to become an internet-age financial services company.”</span></li>
