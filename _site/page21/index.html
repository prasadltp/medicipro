              <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Pay Cash – Another Manifest to Apple's Core Values</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entering the P2P payments game relatively late, Apple definitely makes the right moves to strengthen its closed ecosystem – the company paired its payment solution with the iMessage platform, enabling a seamless experience within an existing channel instead of pushing to download another app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Pay Cash is another manifest to Apple's core values. With this move and its execution, Apple brings into life its worship for convenience, superior user experience and a strong herding of Apple product users that comes with integration into a naturally used channel in the Apple universe. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">iPhone Owners Can Now Send Money to Friends Using Apple Pay Cash</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Apple smartphones are now able to send money to people using its Apple Pay Cash feature, which </span><a href="http://fortune.com/2017/06/06/apple-venmo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was announced in June</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and released in iOS 11.2 Beta</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  $1 is the minimum transfer amount. Funding an Apple Pay Cash account requires adding a minimum of $10. Users can't make a transaction higher than $3,000. Users cannot add more than $10,000 during a 7-day period and Apple Pay Cash accounts cannot hold a balance higher than $20,000.</span></p>

<hr />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demonetization in India has been one of the most-discussed and significant events in the past year. In a strong push towards less-cash society, the government now witnesses an important implication – educational, and transformational for an established mindset. At the end of the day, the mindset of transformation will be the strongest force behind a widespread adoption of cashless operations. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Demonetisation made people understand mobile payments"</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Before demonetisation, we used to see about 50 million transactions a month. A year after demonetisation, we are seeing about 200 million transactions a month, which is a growth of four times on an average number basis. In between, there was a point where we had crossed 260-270 million monthly transactions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"But what demonetization did is not about this. The mindset of the people has changed; there is a shift. We are moving away from being cash-first. Today, if you don’t have cash, and you need to pay somebody, they will simply say why don’t you Paytm me? I believe, we have become part of the mainstream and that I think is pretty incredible." – Paytm Founder &amp; CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/demonetisation-made-people-understand-mobile-payments/article19999095.ece"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on <em>The Hindu.</em></span></p>
<hr />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the mindset changes, the first results of demonetization show – payments using mobile wallets almost doubled in the one-year post demonetization, clocking $1 billion per month in 2017.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile leading the way: Wallet payments almost double in one year in India</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Demonetization resulted in a huge jump in mobile wallet usage immediately after the announcement. Follow-up initiatives from the government, from mobile wallet players, and new initiatives from tech giants, were responsible for maintaining the steady flow in digital payments.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Payments using mobile wallets almost doubled in the one-year post demonetization, clocking $1 billion per month in 2017. They contributed 8.3% (1.6 billion) of the overall volume and 0.02% (US$7 billion) of the overall value of the Indian digital financial system in 2016. M-wallets are expected to surpass 3.1 billion transactions worth more than US$13 billion in 2017.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  With the increase in smartphone penetration as well mobile broadband connectivity, India will largely skip the use of credit and debit cards and move instead to an environment where mobile payments become the largest form of non-cash payments. This process will be quicker compared to other countries like China, mainly because of the following factors: a) Digital India initiatives, b) Increase of 4G data network availability, c) Aggressive mobile wallet strategy. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Paytm is leading the mobile wallet race with a reported user base of 250 million. Paytm enjoyed the first-mover advantage with an aggressive push, marketing discounts, and cashback strategies. Mobikwik ranks second among the top mobile wallets in India, with 65 million users and 3 million daily transactions. The efforts of the top two players are largely concentrated in the top eight cities. Other players like Oxygen are focused on remittances, while players like Ezetap are concentrating on last mile payment solutions for e-commerce.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Mobile wallets are expected to see further penetration in rural India using methods like QR code and mobile number payments.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Going forward, the competition will be even tougher: WhatsApp is set to enter the fray by offering P2P payments through its messaging app. The adoption of Google’s Tez app might also play a significant role as the Android operating system completely dominates the Indian smartphone market.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tele-talk/mobile-leading-the-way-wallet-payments-almost-double-in-one-year-in-india/2693"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on <em>Telecom (the Economic Times).</em></span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Banks Show Major P2P Payment Growth</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  For banks, one of the major problems in gaining traction with P2P payments has been a fragmented market. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  PayPal has become the envy of the financial world with its P2P payments success: In its most recent quarter, P2P payments grew to $24 billion across PayPal's platforms, good for a 47% increase YoY, and P2P payments now represent 21% of PayPal's $114 billion total payment volume. Venmo also continues to show explosive growth – in PayPal's Q3, Venmo processed about $9 billion in payments, a 93% YoY increase. In its recently reported quarter, PayPal reported 1.9 billion transactions across its platforms, a 26% increase YoY. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  As banks saw consumer habits changing, they knew they would have to adapt or risk losing the next generation of consumers. Zelle was their collective solution. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan said the bank had seen "significant growth" in both the number of P2P transactions and payment volume since launching Zelle in June. Sloan also said the company saw 46% growth YoY in P2P payments.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  "In this quarter, Zelle came forward, the latest offering we have in (the) mobile area. ... [O]ur volumes through Zelle this quarter were $4 billion in the third quarter. We processed nearly 14 million transactions, and the growth continues. We recently processed $0.5 billion in a single week. Our customers are using Zelle, and we look forward to further growth in that area," said Brian Moynihan, CEO at Bank of America.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, and Facebook will allow people outside of the US to send money using its messenger app for the first time as it offers mobile payments in the UK. While in the US, Facebook certainly has some competition to measure up to – the UK market is a less competitive market at the moment for small-scale payments. </span><a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/359005-facebook-to-make-mobile-payments-available-in-uk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on <em>The Hill.</em></span></p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to develop and adopt hi-tech has been widely attributed to the startup community rather than to corporate players. The year 2018 will be very different – corporations are gradually taking over the game by either aggressively pressuring startups in developing niches, or by monopolizing the areas of advanced technologies applications by democratizing their adoption. Prices will fall, technology will get more accessible to businesses, and the startup community will face not only peer pressure but a revival of corporate players that are exploring new niches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A series of latest important news suggest that innovation in 2018 may become a corporate game, not a startup, which is dictated by the </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tendayiviki/2017/11/07/how-creating-an-entrepreneurship-function-can-help-sustain-corporate-innovation/#12a935fc12a6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that "with the rapid pace of technological changes and disruption from startups, large corporations are under increasing pressure to respond with innovation."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon is taking over industries at the speed of light. Now, the company is further rooting in the payments space with its latest partnership, 7-Eleven (added to CVS, Speedway, and GameStop, along with a handful of other supermarket chains and convenience stores).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Cash, the service that lets you use cash to shop Amazon online, arrives at 7-Eleven</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Amazon Cash, the service that lets consumers add cash to their Amazon.com balance at brick-and-mortar retailers, is now available at nearly 8,000 7-Eleven convenience stores.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Cash customers represent 27% of consumers. These customers may not be regularly shopping online due to the need to use credit or debit cards at checkout.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Allowing customers to use cash to pay is only way retailers are targeting this market. This year, both Walmart and Amazon made it easier for customers on government assistance to shop on their sites and use their services, too.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  To use Amazon Cash at a 7-Eleven, customers present a personalized barcode found in their Amazon app to the cashier along with the money they want to load. The barcode also can be sent via a text or printed. The cashier then scans the barcode, which immediately adds the funds to the customer’s account balance on Amazon.com.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Customers can load between $15 and $500 in a single transaction, with no fees.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  7-Eleven also carries Amazon prepaid gift cards in denominations from $25 to $500.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  7-Eleven operates, franchises or licenses 10,900 stores in the US and Canada. This launch covers a majority of 7-Eleven’s US footprint. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tencent is reportedly testing its own autonomous driving system</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Tencent, one of China’s largest tech firms and the maker of WeChat, already has a prototype and is testing the system internally.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  If the company's autonomous driving tests go well, it would help Tencent catch up with fellow Chinese tech giant and rival Baidu, which recently launched a $1.5 billion investment fund as part of Apollo, its autonomous vehicle initiative, and plans to mass produce Level 4 self-driving cars by 2021 with BAIC Group.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Tencent recently announced an alliance to work on AI technology for autonomous cars. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Tencent’s auto and driving-related investments include Nio, Didi Chuxing, and a 5% stake in Tesla.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walmart Pay 'Close to Surpassing' Apple Pay in US Mobile Payments Usage</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Available nationwide in 4,774 Walmart stores, Walmart Pay is "close to surpassing" Apple Pay in terms of mobile payments usage in the US. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Walmart Pay is enrolling tens of thousands of new users a day and has seen a steady growth over the past few months. Two-thirds of those who try it use it again within 21 days. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  "Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s app is close to surpassing Apple Pay in usage for mobile payments in the US, giving the world’s largest retailer even more clout as a growing number of people shop with their smartphones."  - Daniel Eckert, SVP of Walmart Services &amp; Digital Acceleration.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Walmart Pay is predicted to grow bigger than Apple Pay in active US users (who use the mobile wallets for at least two transactions per month) by the end of 2018.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Walmart began gaining ground on Apple earlier in 2017, when 5.1% of Walmart shoppers said they used Walmart Pay this past June, just below the 5.5% of iPhone users who said the same at locations that accept Apple Pay. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Walmart Pay's adoption rate is "higher than Samsung Pay and Android Pay combined." This is likely because Walmart owns and controls the mobile wallet software and can make quick changes.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Walmart is more interested in directly competing with Amazon than Apple. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft is a very interesting corporate player that underwent a significant transformation of its image and work. The year 2018 will be a year of Microsoft 2.0 as the company is silently but surely working on an important tech that could potentially transform payments/shopping experience – Keyset Fingerprint Sensor – a fingerprint sensor in a computer’s keyboard that enables a user to press a key to conduct biometric authentication. Old is the new <em>new</em>. With this patent, Microsoft seeks to tie authentication to its devices, locking out competitive security solutions. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Patents Fingerprint Authentication Sensor in Keyboard, Touchscreens</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Microsoft is seeking to build fingerprint sensors into touchscreens and keyboards to authenticate users. For advertising, e-commerce and search, the technology could potentially provide the same type of data as eye tracking only through fingerprint sensors.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Two separate patents were updated or granted in 2017. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  In the first patent, Microsoft received a patent for an under-display fingerprint sensor originally filed in July 2016.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Another Microsoft patent that would put a fingerprint sensor in the keys of computer keyboards would not only impact digital identification &amp; authentication but also e-commerce and advertising.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  The patent called Keyset Fingerprint Sensor would integrate the fingerprint reader in the keyboard's keys. The fingerprint sensor in a computer’s keyboard enables a user to press a key to conduct biometric authentication.</span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  The bank will extend its PoC testing with FinTech firm ThetaRay after early tests showed that the FinTech's technology was able to reduce the number of alerts that did not require further review by 35%.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  By categorizing the flagged transactions by their risk levels more effectively, the accuracy rate of identifying suspicious transactions increased by more than four times, the bank said. The test was based on one year's worth of OCBC corporate banking transaction data.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  The bank targets to fully implement the technology in Q2 2018.</span></p>

<hr />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vodafone Group – which is one of the world’s largest telecommunications companies and provides a range of services including voice, messaging, data and fixed communications – has mobile operations in 26 countries, partners with mobile networks in 49 more, and fixed broadband operations in 17 markets. As of 30 June 2017, Vodafone Group had 523.5 million mobile customers and 18.5 million fixed broadband customers, including India and all of the customers in Vodafone’s joint ventures and associates. The company now is making a move into creating its own IoT ecosystem. At such a scale and having access to an unthinkable amount of data, Vodafone is on a quest to create a small connected world of its own, where it will be able to lock its customers in by resolving any potential needs, locking out the competition. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telecoms giant Vodafone makes push into Internet of Things consumer market</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Vodafone has launched a system that will allow consumers to connect millions of home and leisure electronics products to its dedicated global IoT network.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  Vodafone's 'V by Vodafone' system is made up of, among other things, an IoT SIM card and a smartphone app. The SIM card will be sent out with IoT-enabled products sold by Vodafone, while the app will give customers an overview of all the IoT-enabled products registered to their account.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  The potential economic impact of IoT in 2025, including consumer surplus, could be anything between $3.9 trillion and $11.1 trillion.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  "The internet of things is already beginning to transform how businesses operate," Vittorio Colao, Chief Executive of the Vodafone Group, said in a statement on Tuesday. "Over the next decade, the expansion of Internet of Things into consumer markets will bring about an equally dramatic shift in how people manage their daily lives, at home and in their leisure time."</span></p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p>The ability to develop and adopt hi-tech has been widely attributed to the startup community rather than to corporate players. The year 2018 will be very different – corporations are gradually taking over the game by either aggressively pressuring startups in developing niches, or by monopolizing the areas of advanced technologies applications by democratizing their adoption. Prices will fall, technology will get more accessible to businesses, and the startup community will face not only peer pressure but a revival of corporate players that are exploring new niches.</p>
