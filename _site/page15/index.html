          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to the widespread belief that physical retail is widely believed to be playing a diminishing role in modern lifestyle, the future of commerce will be at the intersection of online and offline worlds. Amazon + Whole Foods, and now Alibaba + Sun Art are defining the winning strategy in global commerce.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese online shopping giant Alibaba pins its hopes on physical stores as it buys hypermarket chain for £2.2 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Alibaba will buy a 36% stake in Sun Art as it tries to cash in on China's $500 billion food retail sector.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Since 2015, Alibaba has invested around £7 billion in physical stores.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The move follows Amazon's £10.3billion purchase of Whole Foods earlier this year, allowing the organic grocery chain to cut prices on its best-selling staple products and begin a delivery service for customers.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">No longer brick-and-mortar vs. online retail: Customers view a ‘single lens’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Despite the ease of online shopping, consumers still crave the tactile experience of physical stores.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Rather than pitting the two channels against each other, retailers can secure a much larger wallet share by giving consumers the best of both worlds through the adoption and use of new technologies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">By offering complimentary benefits, as well as engaging customers via mobile, both in-store and online retailer channels can strengthen overall customer engagement and brand affinity. And the best news for retailers taking an integrated approach: higher revenues and profitability.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Examples: Amazon + Whole Foods, Walmart + Bonobos, Walmart + ModCloth. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The “look before you buy” experience requires a certain level of physical presence. Examples: Casper + Target partnership, Amazon’s Prime Wardrobe, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Online comes together with offline through various beneficial strategies: added offline incentives based on online purchases, payment perks, a more personal customer experience offline integrated with rapid inventory availability online. Examples of blended omnichannel strategy: Best Buy, Home Depot, etc.</span></li>

              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The year 2017 was the most pivotal year for wealth management – technology startups shot themselves in the foot, empowering the next wave of transformation in one of the most asset-heavy segments. Taking their time to watch, interact, and learn, financial institutions have evolved beyond recognition in their strategies. A number of entities have demonstrated the ability to compete with bold technology startups both in terms of adoption of advanced technologies, and costs to the business and consumer. </span><a href="http://newsroom.bbvacompass.com/2016-01-12-BBVA-Compass-teams-with-FutureAdvisor-to-offer-clients-access-to-comprehensive-affordable-investment-advice-anytime-anywhere"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BBVA (&amp; FutureAdvisor)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161115006304/en/Wells-Fargo-Advisors-SigFig-Collaborate-Digital-Advisory"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wells Fargo (&amp; SigFig)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.ftadviser.com/your-industry/2017/06/14/barclays-claims-new-service-beats-robo-advice/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Barclays</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fidelity-launches-automated-investment-advice-service-1469592060"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fidelity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://time.com/money/4371434/capital-one-launches-digital-advice/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital One</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutschebank-funds-idUSKBN0TQ1Z220151207"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deutsche Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/13/reuters-america-morgan-stanley-is-developing-robo-adviser-like-automated-investing-platform-for-wealth-clients-hassan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-bancorp-futureadvisor-team-up-in-another-advance-for-bank-robo-advisers-1472168318"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Bancorp (&amp; FutureAdvisor)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.tdameritrade.com/home.page"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TD Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2017/06/06/tiaa-launches-robo-advisor-with-socially-responsib?slreturn=1501816285"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TIAA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/build-business-not-channel-launching-robo-advisor-inside-large-bank/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UBS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2017/02/08/merrill-edge-launches-robo-advisor-with-a-twist"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merrill Lynch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.investmentexecutive.com/-/atb-launches-new-robo-advisor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ATB</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/26/reuters-america-chinese-banks-brokers-eye-robo-advice-for-edge-on-competition.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">China Merchants Bank (CMB)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/21/goldman-building-robo-adviser-to-give-investment-advice-to-the-masses.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman Sachs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.rbcwealthmanagement.com/us/en/news/2016-02-02/rbc-wealth-management-collaborates-with-futureadvisor-to-launch-digital-advice-pilot-in-the-us/detail/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RBC &amp; FutureAdvisor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.tearsheet.co/modern-banking-experience/bnp-paribas-is-putting-human-advice-before-robots"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BNP Paribas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.sc.com/en/news-and-media/news/global/2017-04-05-SCB-Private-Bank-launches-first-digital-wealth-advisory-tool.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standard Chartered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://about.etrade.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=974739"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E*TRADE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.finews.asia/finance/25987-china-everbright-ginmon-partnership-shanghai-etfs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">China Everbright Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2017/11/20/robo-advisory-moves-should-boost-rbss-profits/#4afd1d14344f"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RBS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2119722/icbc-launches-robo-adviser-service-wealth-management-products"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are just some of the most recent examples of institutional response to the rise of WealthTech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While certainly opportunistic, wealth management is a segment with high barriers to entry, in addition to being </span><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-us-still-has-the-robo-advisor-lead-2017-4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly disproportionate in terms of AUM distribution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Vanguard Personal Advisor Services had </span><a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/vpabroc.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$93 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AUM as of September 2017 – a</span><a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/rating-the-robo-advisors-1501303316"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 12%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growth from October 2016. For comparison, Betterment had ‘only’ </span><a href="https://www.betterment.com/press/newsroom/robo-advisor-betterment-personalization-push-surpasses-10-billion-aum/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$10 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AUM as of July 2017, Wealthfront had $7 billion AUM as of August 2017, and Personal Capital had </span><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/5-billion-aum/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$5 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AUM as of August 2017 (gained $2 billion AUM in 2016 alone).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The above-mentioned hallmarks served an advantage for institutional players to build proprietary solutions to challenge the hype surrounding startups (with the sheer economics always remaining on the institutional side). Lower account minimums, lower fees, rock-bottom commissions, target audience expansion, automated rebalancing, and, in general, a bet on advanced technology + an expert in wealth management, are </span><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/how-financial-institutions-stepping-up-their-game-in-wealth-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the new normal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While non-institutional players will likely fall victim to overcrowding and consolidation of resources through partnerships and acquisitions, startups changed the face of wealth management in the long term. Robo-advisors powered by technology will diminish the barriers to market entry to a range of whole new types of players. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both financial and non-financial services firms can take advantage, bringing new levels of competition and innovation to the industry. For instance, we will likely see more asset management and insurance firms adding wealth advice to their distribution and effectively entering wealth management; non-financial service firms with access to large numbers of retail investors and leading-edge technology firms will likely also enter wealth management through a robo-advice model,” experts from Deloitte </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/strategy/us-cons-disruptors-in-wealth-mgmt-final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emphasize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What did FinTech bring into wealth management exactly? The short answer is AI. </span><a href="https://blogs.thomsonreuters.com/financial-risk/wealth-management-private-banking/how-ai-is-supercharging-wealth-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thompson Reuters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggests that cognitive software platforms, which provide the tools to analyze, organize, access, and provide advisory services based on a range of structured and unstructured data, are set to attract investment of nearly $2.5 billion in this year alone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outlining the ways that AI is supercharging the wealth management industry, </span><a href="https://blogs.thomsonreuters.com/financial-risk/wealth-management-private-banking/how-ai-is-supercharging-wealth-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thompson Reuters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> emphasizes the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Expanding advisory capabilities beyond human capacity following the data explosion (more data will be created in 2017 than in the last 5,000 years. And it’s expected to increase three times from this year until 2021);</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"With AI you can scan the available market data and understand events and triggers that change the market situation and potential performance of certain sectors, certain stocks. It's all about the ability to process a huge amount of data, define the rules and drive the right rules," </span><a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/beyond-robo-advisers-how-ai-could-rewire-wealth-management"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Oliver Bussmann.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Intelligent applications based on cognitive computing, artificial intelligence, and deep learning are the next wave of technology transforming how consumers and enterprises work, learn, and play," </span><a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS42439617"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=PRF003956"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> David Schubmehl</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Research Director, Cognitive Systems and Content Analytics at IDC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These applications are being developed and implemented on cognitive/AI software platforms that offer the tools and capabilities to provide predictions, recommendations, and intelligent assistance through the use of cognitive systems, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Cognitive/AI systems are quickly becoming a key part of IT infrastructure and all enterprises need to understand and plan for the adoption and use of these technologies in their organizations," Schubmehl suggests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The International Data Corporation (</span><a href="http://www.idc.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span><a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS42439617"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forecasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that worldwide revenues for cognitive and AI systems will reach $12.5 billion in 2017, an increase of 59.3% over 2016. Global spending on cognitive and AI solutions will continue to see significant corporate investment over the next several years, achieving a CAGR of 54.4% through 2020 when revenues will be more than $46 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment industry is now shaped by the trend called </span><a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/investment-managers-must-embrace-technological-130000798.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Watsonization</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;">’ which refers to cognitive computing systems that can interpret massive quantities of data, learn as they go, and will hold an information advantage over today’s analysts. They will also give investment firms powerful new tools for interacting with investors, assessing risk, enhancing cybersecurity and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost-efficient robo-advisors that will use sophisticated algorithms to made decisions about funds allocation will make a big wave in the industry and grow the total value of AUM of robo-advisors worldwide to </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/741512/aum-of-robo-advisors-globally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$8.1 trillion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Roughly a billion dollars of value was sent around the Bitcoin network per day in early August. This number declined down to $600 million by late September before exploding to $1.5 billion by late October.</span></li>
