              <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 spotlight: ML/AI</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GS was among the pioneers to replace human traders with AI. At its height back in 2000, the US cash equities trading desk at Goldman Sachs’s New York headquarters employed 600 traders, buying and selling stock on the orders of the investment bank’s large clients. Today there are just two equity traders left. </span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603431/as-goldman-embraces-automation-even-the-masters-of-the-universe-are-threatened/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automated trading programs have taken over the rest of the work, supported by 200 computer engineers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The pattern will be repeated over and over, with 'Warren in a Box' being the most recent example.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">'Warren in a Box' to Pick Stocks for First Nordic AI Fund</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Finnish fund manager FIM is introducing the first investment fund in the Nordic region, where a self-learning algorithm gets to pick all the stocks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The FIM Artificial Intelligence fund seeks to tease out patterns even an experienced fund manager may not detect. “This is the next revolution across society, including in investing,” Chief Investment Officer Eelis Hein, who oversees $6.6 billion in investments at FIM Asset Management, said.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The “Warren in a box” technology, was in development for &gt;2 years. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The algorithm picks 50 stocks from a pre-screened universe of 4,000 liquid, developed-market equities, each with a market capitalization of 1 billion euros or more. After running the Warren algorithm, the AI applies a team-building algorithm, churning out a suitably diversified portfolio from the individual stock picks. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The database contains fundamental data on 700 variables going back to 1986. The fund’s allocation takes place every six months and the actual trading is done by a human.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Decentralized Artificial Intelligence Will Reinvent the Industry As We Know It</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">We are moving toward the next frontier – decentralized AI that can run and train on local devices or make decisions in decentralized networks like blockchain.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The transition to decentralized AI is enabled by new technologies, such as Google’s Federated Learning, that allow for crowd-training of ML algorithms, device-centric AI that runs and trains ML models on mobile devices and the use of AI in DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) on blockchain networks. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Powered by data flowing from thousands of users, and having access to resources and the ability to amass them, decentralized AIs can become a source of huge economic value for its owners.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Using generative models (GANs), we can create AI DAOs that trade in their own art, logos, sketches, images or video clips and distribute profits as cryptocurrency tokens to their shareholders.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">AI DAO can become the only shareholder of the accumulated capital. Example: Terra0. , a project involving an augmented self-owned forest proposed by Paul Seidler and Paul Kolling from the University of Arts, Berlin. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Centralized AI solutions provided as APIs and cloud-based services have certain bottlenecks. Since users access AI features via the network and because ML algorithms involve heavy computations, high latency is often an issue. Also, if you train AI models in a centralized way, it may take more time to improve them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Decentralized AI can function locally on users’ devices, have access to more user data and have no dependence on a network connection, which means less power consumption and minimal latency. Recent advances in decentralized AI have been made thanks to on-device optimization of AI/ML for smartphones and production of dedicated chips for mobile AI and for desktops (e.g., Google’s TPU).</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced details of the new $27million Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) Grant under the Financial Sector Technology and Innovation (FSTI) Scheme</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The new grant aims to promote the adoption and integration of AI and data analytics in financial institutions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The AIDA Grant will focus on two tracks: the Financial Institution Track and the Research Track. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Under the Financial Institution Track, the AIDA Grant will co-fund up to 50% of project costs for Singapore-based financial institutions which leverage AI and data analytics techniques to generate insights, formulate strategy, and assist in their decision making. These techniques may include ML, NLP or text analytics, deep learning or neural networks, predictive and prescriptive analytics.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Under the Research Track, the AIDA Grant will co-fund research institutions’ AI or data analytics projects which have clear applications for Singapore’s financial sector. The AIDA Grant will provide up to 70% co-funding for eligible projects.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The Grant will also provide funding for research projects submitted through periodic calls for proposals on specific AI or data analytics topics that benefit the industry. Such calls will be published on the MAS website.</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">On lending</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paytm and ICICI Bank tie-up to offer short-term instant digital credit</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Paytm has partnered with ICICI Bank to launch ‘Paytm-ICICI Bank Postpaid’ to offer access to interest-free short-term digital credit. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">This is the country’s first tie-up between a Scheduled Commercial Bank and a payments platform to offer instant digital credit for everyday use-cases.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Paytm-ICICI Bank Postpaid is a digital credit account with instant activation: with no hassles of documentation or branch visit. Activation is fully online. There is no transaction joining or hidden administration fees either.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Available 24x7, it is based on a new Big Data-based algorithm by ICICI Bank for the real-time credit assessment of customers. The algorithm uses an intelligent combination of the financial and digital behavior of the customer including credit bureau check, purchase patterns, frequency of purchase to ascertain the creditworthiness of a customer within a few seconds. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Based on the credit score of the customer, the bank offers up to 45 days interest-free credit limit. It ranges from Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 10,000, extendable up to Rs. 20,000 based on the repayment history. Paytm-ICICI Bank Postpaid will also offer a quick checkout to customers with the Paytm Passcode.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Customers can use their Paytm Wallet, debit card or internet banking of any bank for an easy repayment of their dues.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayPal to sell $6 billion in consumer loans to Synchrony Financial</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">PayPal agreed to sell $5.8 billion in consumer credit receivables to Synchrony Financial. These loans will generate $1 billion in revenue for 2017.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The deal also includes Synchrony’s acquisition of $1 billion in participation interests in PayPal receivables held by certain investors and a chartered financial institution.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">As a result of the deal, the two companies will expand their partnership by making Synchrony Bank the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit online consumer financing program available to PayPal customers in the US for the next 10 years.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">For PayPal, the deal means it will lose the interest the loans generate, but it will free up billions that it can use to grow its business in other ways.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Synchrony benefits by tapping into a source of consumer loans that’s more tied to online shopping – which is increasingly where consumers make large purchases requiring credit.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fujitsu Launches Inter-Blockchain Payment System</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fujitsu launched ConnectionChain payments technology aimed at facilitating transactions between blockchain in mid-November 2017. The payments system intends to provide a means for different cryptocurrency networks to interoperate with each other.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To effectively achieve a successful settlement between digital currencies, there should be a dependable application to manage the currency exchange processing at the boundaries between the blockchains in a transparent manner.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The payments technology can resolve the issues surrounding such transactions by inter-connecting multiple blockchains and execute a single transaction process that can be automatically executed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Fujitsu Laboratories has now developed an extension of smart contract technology which inter-connects multiple Blockchains by recording the series of related transactions on each chain in a dedicated Blockchain, or a "connection-type chain," to link to the currency exchange into a single transaction process that can be automatically executed. It has also developed a transaction control technology to synchronize execution timing of the transaction process on each chain."</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fujitsu plans to commercialize the technology starting 2018 (depending on the results of tests).</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">On InsurTech (reality check)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">About 95% of investment in InsurTech distribution models will be wasted, claims Guidewire Chief Executive Marcus Ryu. Recent investments in InsurTech amount to a bubble. $3.5bn has been invested in InsurTech over the past few years. It is not possible to spend that money productively, Ryu warned.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Areas of InsurTech spending that are relevant and useful: satellite and commercial sensor data aggregation and photo-based estimating. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Attempts to change insurance distribution models will not be a disruptive force and worth the amount of money that has been funneled into it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">InsurTech companies are using the metric of customer acquisition to show progress. It is a good way to measure progress for consumer internet firms but does not lead to a tangible benefit for an insurer. “If you’re an insurance company it’s very easy to get customer acquisition. Any insurance company can acquire all the customers they want and lose money on every one of them. The fact that they were thinking in terms of consumer internet attitude [is telling], you have to spend a lot, take lot of losses, but acquire a lot of customers and then figure out how to make money on them later. It does not work.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Interesting things were being seen in smaller volume markets. Success there is likely caused by the ability to tackle a small segment of the overall market with niche products.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">P2P insurance risk-sharing models are tiny and not consequential yet. They should be viewed as experiments and they are all currently “significantly loss-making.”</span></li>

              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a minimum, payment technology should create a path of least resistance for the consumer, as difficulty in settling an outstanding bill means organizations risk missing out on prompt payments. The consumer must be able to move freely between the payment channels they choose – just because a consumer receives an outstanding bill through the mail doesn't mean they want to reply the same way. It may be more convenient to pay online or contact the agency by phone to pay the bill or negotiate a payment plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://start.mybillingtree.com/acton/media/15831/2017-arm-survey-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 Collection Agency Operations and Technology Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed businesses agree with this. Technology adoption and offering a variety of payment channels continued to be top priorities. Automated payments, interactive voice response (IVR) and virtual debt negotiation were three of the most popular payment methods, with many agencies realizing the benefits these technologies can bring – including 24/7 payments and streamlining manual, time-consuming processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is these three technologies that will really help collection agencies improve their bottom line, even as industry and consumer demands change in the future.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automated payments – simple yet effective </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An automated payment plan is simple and user-friendly, keeping payments on-time and customers happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With automated payment plans through a web portal, a notification is sent electronically to the consumer. When accepted, the notification will automatically trigger a payment which is instantly taken out of the client’s account for each billing cycle. Automated systems like these are affordable, smart and can even integrate with current core systems, meaning agencies of all sizes can quickly reap the rewards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automated payments through portals have been helping the healthcare industry improve its revenue cycle management by letting patients receive electronic statements and pay their bills online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-gray-8815177/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh Gray</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vice President, athenaResearch, online access translates into financial rewards, "When clients increase portal adoption by 20% or more, they see improvements in patient pay yields of four to eight percent. They get paid more and faster. If you can get a patient on a portal, they're 13% more likely to return. The value of the patient who returns is eight to 20% higher." </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent healthcare report from athenaResearch cites the Summit Medical Group, a 500-physician group in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, as an example of one group that now receives 30% of its patient payments via online portals.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interactive Voice Response – prompt payments, more time for accounts staff</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology uses automated call scripts which allow the consumer to pay via touch-tone prompts, helping improve the consumer experience. Providing consumers with a simple automated method to pay a bill, whenever and however they want to, can significantly improve the chances of receiving a payment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But IVR technology isn't just a great way to improve payment collections and enhance customer service – the technology also frees up time for accounts receivable staff to deal with more critical work that needs their attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pmgray/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phil Gray</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, executive vice president of Interactions, developers of enterprise intelligent assistants, IVR system has helped his company cut down on missed calls by 60% and that the technology has directly led to a 15% increase in revenue per call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are still challenges for companies looking to adopt IVR systems. An IVR system not designed with the customer in mind has the potential to decrease the likelihood of payment through this method. A quick resolution is what customers are looking for when they are using IVR, and if your automated system fails to meet this expectation, then the chances are the customer will permanently ditch your services and find another way to pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ease of use is another challenge. Customers prefer using systems that require the least effort and time. More complex and time-consuming IVR will turn them off, so having an easy to understand the system with as few steps as possible will help collections rather than hinder them.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual Negotiation – discuss your payment plan in private</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a consumer can’t settle their bill in full, then it might be time to negotiate. Virtual negotiation technology is enabling consumers to handle this privately, online, and without the discomfort or embarrassment of face-to-face interaction – and again saving employee time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A three-step process enables the consumer and the accounts receivable department to agree to a payment plan that works for both. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">1. The consumer is first notified of a minimum payment amount and maximum payment length. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">2. They can then either accept or make a counteroffer of how much they would like to pay back and for how long. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">3. The virtual negotiation system will then accept or reject the offer. If rejected, the consumer will receive a further counter offer which they can either accept or reject or re-negotiate the amount or length of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer demands and an ever-changing business environment make it crucial for collectors to offer an expanded virtual negotiation technology solution for easy access to payment information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But many technology vendors in today’s collection industry offer systems that are made up of individual products stuck together rather than integrated. The results are inefficient systems that are being forced together, often losing some of the critical functionality of each separate solution. The training process can also be difficult, as managers need to learn how to operate all of the new products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, collection organizations considering a new technology purchase – or an upgrade of their existing system – should look for a vendor that offers a complete, integrated solution. The solution needs to have the flexibility to meet their changing needs, to grow as they grow and not box them into a limited system – a single, unified platform that eases collection pains.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology crucial to better collections</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The integration of different payment collection technologies is a top priority for agencies, and technology solution providers will play a critical role in helping the ARM industry remain competitive and profitable in the future.</span></p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">On trends – banks are still the masters of the financial services industry </span></h1>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman Sachs’ Marcus is winning the personal loans arms race</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Marcus is pushing an us-versus-them anti-fee campaign highlighting potentially predatory practices of online lenders like Lending Club.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">As of late Monday, Marcus by Goldman Sachs lent $2 billion to customers. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Meanwhile, Lending Club has reported losses exceeding $200 million over the last six quarters; Prosper has lost $210 million since the start of 2016, despite various cost-cutting measures, and lost its unicorn status. Even OnDeck Capital, which focuses on small businesses, is struggling to become profitable, having reported losses over eight consecutive quarters. On top of it, the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank laid into such companies in a report Thursday, calling online lending a “predatory” business requiring more regulation. Marcus passed $1 billion in loans this summer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Marcus, which offers personal loans to consumers between $3,500 and $30,000, has obvious advantages over its Silicon Valley competitors: a household name brand like Goldman Sachs behind it, the ability to raise FDIC-insured deposits as a deposit-taking institution and deep relationships with institutional investors that purchase consumer loans — like Goldman Sachs, which helps fund Prosper loans and is effectively competing with its own customer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Goldman sees a $13 billion lending opportunity with Marcus over three years, CFO Marty Chavez said Tuesday in remarks at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Future of Financials Conference.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Since late October, Marcus has been pushing an anti-fee campaign scripted to show how frequently and commonly people accept fees without fully understanding why the fee structure is in place in the first place and perhaps even highlight the fee structures at competing companies; namely, Lending Club, one of the largest players in online lending with more fees in place than its peers.</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech sector needs a meaningful investment fund says challenger bank boss</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexletts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Letts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the founder of a challenger bank U (~50,000 customers), said that the sector is some way off from having the firepower to sufficiently challenge the mainstream banking sector and called for the establishment of a meaningful investment fund to support FinTech startups. </span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Mr. Letts questions whether the challenger banks were radically different from mainstream banking, positing that some had simply “put new clothes on the emperor”. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“The other side are what I call the ‘neobanks,’ people coming in with much hurrah and hysteria and telling everyone that the big banks are finished and that they are going to take over the world. I can absolutely tell you they are not. But what I can say is that incremental change for them is very easy and simple. They have beautiful digital footprints, the support of regulators and in many cases some very bright people running them and a modern attitude."</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">“I do believe in their skills and that they can offer a brighter fresher future for banking but I don’t believe they have done anything truly disruptive. I do not believe that they have done anything more than put new clothes on the emperor.”</span></li>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">On fraud</span></h1>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2/3 of Businesses Experienced Increased Fraud Attempts in 2017, a 58% Increase over Previous Year – IDology Annual Fraud Report</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Shifting tactics used by criminals, along with the complexity of identity verification are the top challenges to fraud prevention.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Addressing rising synthetic identity fraud and improving the customer experience by reducing friction are key areas of strategic interest.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">More than half of companies reported an increase in mobile-based fraud, led by device cloning.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">About 67% of organizations reported an increase in fraud attempts, compared to just 42 percent in 2016, an increase of 58 percent. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Criminals are using more sophisticated schemes that are harder to detect, such as synthetic identity fraud (SIF), a combination of real and fabricated identity information used to create a new identity. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">"The data indicates that fraud is growing in prevalence, type, and sophistication and this is changing how businesses approach the identity verification value chain," said John Dancu, CEO of IDology. "In today's post-breach environment, pulling together and assessing identities based on several smart layers of information from different sources, including data on mobile devices, ensures legitimate customers are approved with less friction for a more secure and positive experience."</span></li>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">On payments</span></h1>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital payments expected to hit 726 billion by 2020 — but cash isn't going anywhere yet</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">People around the world are expected to make 726 billion transactions using digital payment technologies by 2020. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Emerging markets are leading the upward trend, and tech innovations such as connected homes, contactless bank cards, wearable devices and augmented reality will drive cashless transactions in the future.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">"Curiously, though the number of transactions continues to rise at a rapid rate, the average USD value per transaction has decreased slightly, as digital establishes itself as a growing rival to cash for low-cost purchases."</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Between 2014 and 2015, debit cards accounted for the highest share of non-cash payments at 46.7%, while credit cards trailed behind at 19.5%. Non-cash transactions rose 11.2%, the highest growth of the past decade.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Contactless cards are seen as "the new normal," especially in Europe. In France, the circulation of Visa contactless cards doubled to 40 million in 2015 from 20.3 million the previous year. The U.K. was the biggest market for contactless payments in Europe, with cards in circulation reaching 106.9 million in 2015.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">But cash still remains the mainstream means of payment, especially for low-value transactions. "Cash continues to play a key role for many, and a crucial role for some," Bank of England Chief Cashier Victoria Cleland said.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Americans still look to cash as their preferred method of payment — although physical cash came in second place, behind debit cards.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Emerging markets are expected to grow at a rate three times that of developed economies in terms of digital transaction volumes. Non-cash payments in Asian emerging markets are projected to grow by almost a third (30.9%), led by powerhouses China and India. Digital invoicing, virtual payment cards and cloud-based accounting are also seeing popular use in emerging Asian economies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">FinTech firms and incoming regulation are transforming the payments landscape. "Within this new and dynamic ecosystem, payments industry participants must strategically reassess their roles," Anirban Bose, head of global banking and capital markets at Capgemini. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">In an open banking ecosystem, banks are expected to open up their application programming interfaces (APIs) to third-party payment providers. APIs are codes that allow different financial programs to communicate with each other. Open APIs allow developers to gain access to the software applications of banks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">"Banks must embrace this opportunity to enhance their offerings in collaboration with FinTechs and third-party developers. Breakthrough technologies and significant industry advances, such as open APIs, instant payments, blockchain and regulatory standardization, will encourage collaboration," Bose said. </span></li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three justices issued a notice to the central bank, the market regulator, the tax department, and several other agencies, </span><a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-seeks-govts-response-on-plea-to-regulate-bitcoin/article20445197.ece"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asking them to answer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a petition on the matter.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">According to the petition: "The lack of any concrete [control] mechanism pending the regulatory framework in said regard has left a lot of vacuum and which has resulted in total unaccountability and unregulated Bitcoin (crypto money) trading and transactions."</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">The petition goes on to state that bitcoin exchanges in India add 2,500 users per day, and that some 500,000 residents now hold bitcoin. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">As a result of its adoption, bitcoin usage may affect "the market value of other commodities," according to the petition, which pleaded with the court for an "urgent direction" for the government to intervene.</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">UK Financial Authority Warns Investors Against Cryptocurrency Derivatives</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">FCA has issued a warning to investors against venturing into cryptocurrency contracts for differences (CFDs). The agency claimed that digital currency-based CFDs are considered to be high-risk investments.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FCA </span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/consumer-warning-about-risks-investing-cryptocurrency-cfds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">issued its warning to investors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against investing in crypto-based CFDs due to several risks that they could face, among which are price volatility, leverage, charges and funding costs and price transparency. The legal safeguards currently in place cannot protect investors and will not compensate them for any losses that they could incur from trading.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">In June 2017, FCA Director of Strategy and Competition, Chris Woolard, warned that investors should exercise a degree of caution when dealing with cryptocurrencies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, the </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-issues-warning-against-onecoin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has also cautioned that </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-issues-warning-against-onecoin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICOs are “very risky”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investments and asked would-be participants to inform or report to the agency any possible fraud that they may encounter in the cryptocurrency-based funding model.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">Other countries such as Germany, United States, and the Netherlands have also released their warnings about investing in ICOs earlier this month.</span></li>
